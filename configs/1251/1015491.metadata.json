    "Population is the most commonly used metric throughout Our World in Data. It is used directly to understand population growth over time, and indirectly to calculate per-capita indicators, making it easier to compare countries of different sizes.",
    "We construct this indicator by combining multiple sources covering different periods.\n  - HYDE v3.3 (2023): historical estimates from 10,000 BCE to 1799.\n  - Gapminder v7 (2022): for 1800-1949.\n  - UN World Population Prospects (2024): for 1950 onwards, including 2100 projections.\n  - Gapminder Systema Globalis (2023): additional source for former countries (Yugoslavia, USSR, etc.)",
    "Breaks in the data may occur at the boundaries between sources due to their methodological differences.",
    "You can read more about the sources and methodology in our [dedicated article](https://ourworldindata.org/population-sources). We also provide a table of sources showing the source we use for each country-year.",
    "We calculate geographical aggregates (continents, income groups, etc.) by summing individual country populations. For years before 1800, we rely directly on HYDE's values for continents to ensure historical consistency."
