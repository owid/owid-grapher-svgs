2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland \nfreshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line \nwith obligations under international agreements \nIndicator 15.1.2: Proportion of important sites for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity that are \ncovered by protected areas, by ecosystem type \n\n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \nUN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) \nBirdLife International (BLI) \nInternational Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n \nDefinition: \nThis indicator Proportion of important sites for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity that are covered by \nprotected areas shows temporal trends in the mean percentage of each important site for terrestrial and \nfreshwater biodiversity (i.e., those that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity) \nthat is covered by designated protected areas. \n \nRationale: \nThe safeguard of important sites is vital for stemming the decline in biodiversity and ensuring long term \nand sustainable use of terrestrial and freshwater natural resources. The establishment of protected areas \nis an important mechanism for achieving this aim, and this indicator serves as a means of measuring \nprogress toward the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and freshwater \necosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with \nobligations under international agreements. Importantly, while it can be disaggregated to report on any \ngiven single ecosystem of interest (e.g., forests), it is not restricted to any single ecosystem type, and so \nfaithfully reflects the intent of SDG target 15.1. \n \nLevels of access to protected areas vary among the protected area management categories. Some areas, \nsuch as scientific reserves, are maintained in their natural state and closed to any other use. Others are \nused for recreation or tourism, or even open for the sustainable extraction of natural resources. In \naddition to protecting biodiversity, protected areas have high social and economic value: supporting local \nlivelihoods; protecting watersheds from erosion; harbouring an untold wealth of genetic resources; \nsupporting thriving recreation and tourism industries; providing for science, research and education; and \nforming a basis for cultural and other non-material values. \n \nThis indicator adds meaningful information to, complements and builds from traditionally reported \nsimple statistics of terrestrial and freshwater area covered by protected areas, computed by dividing the \ntotal protected area within a country by the total territorial area of the country and multiplying by 100 \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 11 July 2017 \n\n(e.g., Chape et al. 2005). Such percentage area coverage statistics do not recognise the extreme variation \nof biodiversity importance over space (Rodrigues et al. 2004), and so risk generating perverse outcomes \nthrough the protection of areas which are large at the expense of those which require protection. \n \nThe indicator is used to track progress towards the 2011–2020 Strategic Plan for Biodiversity (CBD 2014, \nTittensor et al. 2014), and was used as an indicator towards the Convention on Biological Diversity’s 2010 \nTarget (Butchart et al. 2010). \n \nConcepts: \nProtected areas, as defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN; Dudley 2008), \nare clearly defined geographical spaces, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other \neffective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and \ncultural values. Importantly, a variety of specific management objectives are recognised within this \ndefinition, spanning conservation, restoration, and sustainable use: \n \n\n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n\nCategory Ia: Strict nature reserve \nCategory Ib: Wilderness area \nCategory II: National park \nCategory III: Natural monument or feature \nCategory IV: Habitat/species management area \nCategory V: Protected landscape/seascape \nCategory VI: Protected area with sustainable use of natural resources \n\n \nThe status \"designated\" is attributed to a protected area when the corresponding authority, according to \nnational legislation or common practice (e.g., by means of an executive decree or the like), officially \nendorses a document of designation. The designation must be made for the purpose of biodiversity \nconservation, not de facto protection arising because of some other activity (e.g., military). \n \nSites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity are identified following globally \nstandard criteria for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas (IUCN 2016) applied at national levels. \nTwo variants of these standard criteria have been applied in all countries to date. The first is for the \nidentification of Important Bird & Biodiversity Areas, that is, sites contributing significantly to the global \npersistence of biodiversity, identified using data on birds, of which >12,000 sites in total have been \nidentified from all of the world’s countries (BirdLife International 2014). The second is for the \nidentification of Alliance for Zero Extinction sites (Ricketts et al. 2005), that is, sites holding effectively the \nentire population of at least one species assessed as Critically Endangered or Endangered on The IUCN \nRed List of Threatened Species. In total, 587 Alliance for Zero Extinction sites have been identified for 920 \nspecies of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, conifers, and reef-building corals. A global standard for \nthe identification of Key Biodiversity Areas unifying these approaches along with other mechanisms for \nidentification of important sites for other species and ecosystems was approved by IUCN (2016). \n \nComments and limitations: \nQuality control criteria are applied to ensure consistency and comparability of the data in the World \nDatabase on Protected Areas. New data are validated at UNEP-WCMC through a number of tools and \ntranslated into the standard data structure of the World Database on Protected Areas. Discrepancies \nbetween the data in the World Database on Protected Areas and new data are minimised by provision of \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 11 July 2017 \n\na manual (UNEP-WCMC 2016) and resolved in communication with data providers. Similar processes \napply for the incorporation of data into the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas. \n \nThe indicator does not measure the effectiveness of protected areas in reducing biodiversity loss, which \nultimately depends on a range of management and enforcement factors not covered by the indicator. A \nnumber of initiatives are underway to address this limitation. Most notably, numerous mechanisms have \nbeen developed for assessment of protected area management, which can be synthesised into an \nindicator (Leverington et al. 2010). This is used by the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership as a \ncomplementary indicator of progress towards Aichi Biodiversity Target 11  \n(http://www.bipindicators.net/pamanagement). However, there may be little relationship between these \nmeasures and protected area outcomes (Nolte & Agrawal 2013). More recently, approaches to “green \nlisting” have started to be developed, to incorporate both management effectiveness and the outcomes \nof protected areas, and these are likely to become progressively important as they are tested and applied \nmore broadly. \n \nData and knowledge gaps can arise due to difficulties in determining whether a site conforms to the IUCN \ndefinition of a protected area, and some protected areas are not assigned management categories. \nMoreover, “other effective area-based conservation measures”, as specified by Aichi Biodiversity Target  \n11 of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020, recognise that some sites beyond the formal \nprotected area network, while not managed primarily for nature conservation, may nevertheless be \nmanaged in ways which are consistent with the persistence of the biodiversity for which they are \nimportant (Jonas et al. 2014). However, standard approaches to documentation of “other effective area-\nbased conservation measures” are still under debate through the IUCN Task Force on Other Effective \nAreas Based Conservation Measures which will conclude with recommendations for a definition on \nOECMs. Once defined it is likely OEMCs will be documented in the World Database on Protected Areas. \n \nRegarding important sites, the biggest limitation is that site identification to date has focused on specific \nsubsets of biodiversity, for example birds (for Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas) and highly \nthreatened species (for Alliance for Zero Extinction sites). While Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas \nhave been documented to be good surrogates for biodiversity more generally (Brooks et al. 2001, Pain et \nal. 2005), the application of the unified standard for identification of Key Biodiversity Areas (IUCN 2016) \nsites across different levels of biodiversity (genes, species, ecosystems) and different taxonomic groups \nremains a high priority, building from efforts to date (Eken et al. 2004, Knight et al. 2007, Langhammer et \nal. 2007, Foster et al. 2012). \n \nKey Biodiversity Area identification has been validated for a number of countries and regions where \ncomprehensive biodiversity data allow formal calculation of the site importance (or “irreplaceability”) \nusing systematic conservation planning techniques (Di Marco et al. 2016, Montesino Pouzols et al. 2014). \n \nFuture developments of the indicator will include: a) expansion of the taxonomic coverage of terrestrial \nand freshwater Key Biodiversity Areas through application of the Key Biodiversity Areas standard (IUCN \n2016) to a wide variety of terrestrial and freshwater vertebrates, invertebrates, plants and ecosystem \ntype; b) improvements in the data on protected areas by continuing to increase the proportion of sites \nwith documented dates of designation and with digitised boundary polygons (rather than coordinates); \nand c) exploring other methods for assessing and presenting temporal trends in protected area coverage. \n \n\n\f \n\nMethodology \n\nLast updated: 11 July 2017 \n\n \nComputation Method: \nThis indicator is calculated from data derived from a spatial overlap between digital polygons for \nprotected areas from the World Database on Protected Areas (IUCN & UNEP-WCMC 2017) and digital \npolygons for terrestrial and freshwater Key Biodiversity Areas (from the World Database of Key  \nBiodiversity Areas, including Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas, Alliance for Zero Extinction sites, and \nother Key Biodiversity Areas; available through the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool). The value of \nthe indicator at a given point in time, based on data on the year of protected area establishment \nrecorded in the World Database on Protected Areas, is computed as the mean percentage of each Key \nBiodiversity Area currently recognised that it covered by protected areas. \n \nYear of protected area establishment is unknown for 12% of protected areas in the World Database on \nProtected Areas, generating uncertainty around changing protected area coverage over time. To reflect \nthis uncertainty, a year was randomly assigned from another protected area within the same country, \nand then this procedure repeated 1,000 times, with the median plotted. In 2017 we slightly changed the \nmethods described by Butchart et al. (2012, 2015) by randomly assigning a year to protected areas with \nno year of establishment before calculating trends in coverage. This is a computationally more efficient \nmethod and is likely to reflect more accurately changes in protected area coverage over time.  \n \nPreviously the indicator was presented as the percentage of Key Biodiversity Areas completely covered \nby protected areas. However, it is now presented as the mean % of each Key Biodiversity Area that is \ncovered by protected areas in order to better reflect trends in protected area coverage for countries or \nregions with few or no Key Biodiversity Areas that are completely covered.  \n \nDisaggregation: \nGiven that data for the global indicator are compiled at national levels, it is straightforward to \ndisaggregate to national and regional levels (e.g., Han et al. 2014), or conversely to aggregate to the \nglobal level. Key Biodiversity Areas span all ecosystem types, including marine (Edgar et al. 2008), \nfreshwater (Holland et al. 2012), and mountains (Rodríguez-Rodríguez et al. 2011, UNEP-WCMC 2002). \nThe indicator can therefore be reported in combination across terrestrial and freshwater (and indeed \nmarine) systems, or disaggregated among them. However, individual Key Biodiversity Areas can \nencompass terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems simultaneously, and so determining the results is \nnot simply additive. Finally, the indicator can be disaggregated according to different protected area \nmanagement categories (categories I–VI) to reflect differing specific management objectives of protected \nareas. \n \nIn addition to the aggregation of the coverage of protected areas across important sites for terrestrial \nand freshwater biodiversity as an indicator towards SDG 15.1, other disaggregations of coverage of \nprotected areas of particular relevance as indicators towards SDG targets (Brooks et al. 2016) include: \n \nSDG 14.5.1 Coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas. \nSDG 15.4.1 Coverage by protected areas of important sites for mountain biodiversity. \n \nProtected area coverage data can be combined with other data sources to yield further, complementary, \nindicators. For example, protected area overlay with ecoregional maps can be used to provide \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 11 July 2017 \n\ninformation on protected area coverage of different broad biogeographical regions. Protected area \ncoverage of the distributions of different groups of species (e.g., mammals, birds, amphibians) can \nsimilarly provide indicators of trends in coverage of biodiversity at the species level. Protected area \ncoverage can be combined with the Red List Index to generate indicators of the impacts of protected \nareas in reducing biodiversity loss (Butchart et al. 2012). Finally, indicators derived from protected area \noverlay can also inform sustainable urban development; for example, the overlay of protected areas onto \nurban maps could provide an indicator of public space as a proportion of overall city space. \n \nTreatment of missing values: \n\n•  At country level \n\nData are available for protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas in all of the world’s countries, and so no \nimputation or estimation of national level data is necessary. \n \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\nGlobal indicators of protected area coverage of important sites for biodiversity are calculated as the \nmean percentage of each Key Biodiversity Area that is covered by protected areas. The data are \ngenerated from all countries, and so while there is uncertainty around the data, there are no missing \nvalues as such and so no need for imputation or estimation. \n \nRegional aggregates: \nUNEP-WCMC is the agency in charge of calculating and reporting global and regional figures for this \nindicator, working with BirdLife International and IUCN to combine data on protected areas with those \nfor sites of importance for biodiversity. UNEP-WCMC aggregates the global and regional figures on \nprotected areas from the national figures that are calculated from the World Database on Protected \nAreas and disseminated through Protected Planet. The World Database on Protected Areas and \nProtected Planet are jointly managed by UNEP-WCMC and IUCN and its World Commission on Protected \nAreas. The World Database on Protected Areas is held within a Geographic Information System that \nstores information about protected areas such as their name, size, type, date of establishment, \ngeographic location (point) and/or boundary (polygon). Protected area coverage is calculated using all  \nthe protected areas recorded in World Database on Protected Areas whose location and extent is known. \nProtected areas without digital boundaries are excluded from the indicator. \n \nImportant Bird and Biodiversity Areas are sites of international significance for the conservation of \nbiodiversity, identified using data for birds. Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas are identified using a \nstandardised set of data-driven criteria and thresholds, relating to threatened, restricted-range, biome-\nrestricted and congregatory species. Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas are delimited so that, as far as \npossible, they: (a) are different in character, habitat or ornithological importance from surrounding areas; \n(b) provide the requirements of the trigger species (i.e., those for which the site qualifies) while present, \nalone or in combination with networks of other sites; and (c) are or can be managed in some way. \n \nAlliance for Zero Extinction sites meet three criteria: endangerment (supporting at least one Endangered \nor Critically Endangered species, as listed on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species); irreplaceability \n(holding the sole or overwhelmingly significant (=95%) known population of the target species, for at \nleast one life history segment); and discreteness (having a definable boundary within which the character \nof habitats, biological communities, and/or management issues have more in common with each other \nthan they do with those in adjacent areas). Hence Alliance for Zero Extinction sites represent locations at \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 11 July 2017 \n\nwhich species extinctions are imminent unless appropriately safeguarded (i.e. protected or managed \nsustainably in ways consistent with the persistence of populations of target species). \n \nThe Important Bird and Biodiversity Area and Alliance for Zero Extinction site networks are, by definition, \nareas of particular importance for biodiversity as referred to in Aichi Biodiversity Target 11, and represent \nthe only networks of such sites that have been identified systematically worldwide. Hence, they \nrepresent important areas to consider designating as formal protected areas. \n \nSources of discrepancies: \nNational processes provide the great bulk of the data that are subsequently aggregated into both the \nWorld Database on Protected Areas and the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas, and so there are \nvery few differences between national indicators and the global one. One minor source of difference is \nthat the World Database on Protected Areas incorporates internationally-designated protected areas \n(e.g., World Heritage sites, Ramsar sites, etc), a few of which are not considered by their sovereign \nnations to be protected areas.  \n \nNote that because countries do not submit comprehensive data on degazetted protected areas to the \nWDPA, earlier values of the indictor may marginally underestimate coverage. \n \nMethods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level: \nThe WDPA has its origins in a 1959 UN mandate when the United Nations Economic and Social Council \ncalled for a list of national parks and equivalent reserves Resolution 713 (XXVIII). More details are \navailable here: https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas. The UN List of \nProtected Areas has been published in 1961/62, 1966/71, 1972 (addendum to the 1966/71 edition), \n1973, 1974, 1975, 1980, 1982, 1985, 1990, 1993, 1997, 2003 and 2014 which have resulted in a global \nnetwork of national data providers for the WDPA. For example, in 2014 all Convention on Biological \nDiversity (CBD) National Focal points and all National Focal points for the CBD Protected Areas \nProgramme of Work (PoWPA) to request data for the 2014 Un List of Protected Areas \n(https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas/united-nations-list-of-\nprotected-areas-2014). Protected areas data is therefore compiled directly from government agencies, \nregional hubs and other authoritative sources in the absence of a government source. All records have a \nunique metadata identifier (MetadataID) which links the spatial database to the Source table where all \nsources are described. The data is collated and standardised following the WDPA Data Standards and \nvalidated with the source. The process of collation, validation and publication of data as well as protocols \nand the WDPA data standards are regularly updated in the WDPA User Manual \n(https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual) made available through www.protectedplanet.net \nwhere all spatial data and the Source table are also published every month and can be downloaded.   The \nprocess for compilation of data on sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity \n(Key Biodiversity Areas) is documented online (http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home). Specifically, \n(http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/what-are-kbas), the Key Biodiversity Area identification process is \na highly inclusive, consultative and bottom-up exercise. Although anyone with appropriate scientific data \nmay propose a site to qualify as a Key Biodiversity Area, wide consultation with stakeholders at the \nnational level (both non-governmental and governmental organizations) is required during the proposal \nprocess. Key Biodiversity Area identification builds off the existing network of Key Biodiversity Areas, \nincluding those identified as Important Bird & Biodiversity Areas through the BirdLife Partnership of 120 \nnational organisations (http://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/partnership/birdlife-partners), for the \nAlliance for Zero Extinction by 93 national and international organisations \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 11 July 2017 \n\n(http://www.zeroextinction.org/partners.html), and as other Key Biodiversity Areas by civil society \norganisations supported by the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund in developing ecosystem profiles, \nnamed in each of the profiles listed here \n(http://www.cepf.net/resources/publications/Pages/ecosystem_profiles.aspx), with new data \nstrengthening and expanding expand the network of these sites. Any site proposal undergoes \nindependent scientific review. This is followed by the official site nomination with full documentation \nmeeting the Documentation Standards for Key Biodiversity Areas. Sites confirmed by the Key Biodiversity \nAreas Secretariat to qualify as Key Biodiversity Areas then appear on the Key Biodiversity Areas website \n(http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home). \n \nThe WDPA User Manual (https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual)  published in English, \nSpanish, and French provides guidance to countries on how to submit protected areas data to the WDPA, \nwhat are the benefits of providing such data, which are the data standards and which quality checks are \nperformed. We also provide a summary of our methods to calculate protected areas coverage to all \nWDPA users: https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/calculating-protected-area-coverage. The “Global \nStandard for the Identification of Key Biodiversity Areas” (https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259) \ncomprises the standard recommendations available to countries in the identification of Key Biodiversity \nAreas, with further guidelines available on the Key Biodiversity Areas website \n(http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home). Specifically, (http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-\ninvolved), the main steps of the Key Biodiversity Area identification process are the following:  \n\ni) \n\nii) \n\niii) \n\niv) \n\nsubmission of Expressions of Intent to identify a Key Biodiversity Area to Regional Focal \nPoints;  \nproposal Development process, in which proposers compile relevant data and \ndocumentation and consult national experts, including organizations that have already \nidentified Key Biodiversity Areas in the country, either through national Key Biodiversity Area \nCoordination Groups or independently;  \nreview of proposed Key Biodiversity Areas by Independent Expert Reviewers, verifying the \naccuracy of information within their area of expertise; and  \na Site Nomination phase comprising the submission of all the relevant documentation for \nverification by the Key Biodiversity Areas Secretariat (see section 3.3 below).  \n\nOnce a Key Biodiversity Area is identified, monitoring of its qualifying features and its conservation status \nis important. Proposers, reviewers and those undertaking monitoring can join the Key Biodiversity Areas \nCommunity to exchange their experiences, case studies and best practice examples. \n \nQuality assurance \nThe process on how the data is collected, standardised and published is available in the WDPA User \nManual at: https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual which is available in English, French and \nSpanish. Specific guidance is provided at https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-\nprotected-areas on, for example, predefined fields or look up tables in the WDPA: \nhttps://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-lookup-tables, how WDPA records are coded how \ninternational designations  and regional designations data is collected, how regularly is the database \nupdated, and how to perform protected areas coverage statistics.   The process of identification of Key \nBiodiversity Areas is supported by the Key Biodiversity Areas Partnership \n(http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/kba-partners). Among the roles of the partnership is establishment \nof the Key Biodiversity Areas Secretariat, which checks information submitted in the Site Nomination \nphase for the correct application of the Key Biodiversity Areas Standard \n((https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259), and the adequacy of site documentation and then verifies \nthe site, which is then published on the Key Biodiversity Areas Website \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 11 July 2017 \n\n(http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved). In addition, the Chairs of the IUCN Species Survival \nCommission and World Commission on Protected Areas (both of whom are elected by the IUCN \nMembership of governments and non-governmental organisations), appoint the Chair of an independent \nKey Biodiversity Areas Standards and Appeals Committee, which ensures the correct application of the \nGlobal Standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas. The R code for calculating protected area \ncoverage of KBAs is documented as Dias, M. (2017) “R code for calculating protected area coverage of \nKBAs” \n(http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/userfiles/files/R_code_for_calculating_protected_area_coverage_\nof_KBAs_March_2017.pdf).  \n \nIn addition to dissemination via the Protected Planet website (https://www.protectedplanet.net/), the \nUN List process described in 3.1 the fact that protected areas data is collected from national agencies \nacknowledged in the WDPA metadata, and Key Biodiversity Areas website \n(http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home), Protected Planet and Key Biodiversity Areas data are \ndisseminated through the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool, available for research and \nconservation online (https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/). This incorporates Country Profile \ndocuments for all of the world’s countries, which includes documentation of the indicator of protected \narea coverage of Key Biodiversity Areas for the current year, starting from 2016. The first edition of each \nof these Country Profiles was sent for consultation to National Focal Points of the Convention on \nBiological Diversity (https://www.cbd.int/information/nfp.shtml), at the 13th meeting of the Conference \nof the Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity; and this process will be repeated annually. \n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \nProtected area data are compiled by ministries of environment and other ministries responsible for the \ndesignation and maintenance of protected areas. Protected Areas data for sites designated under the \nRamsar Convention and the UNESCO World Heritage Convention are collected through the relevant \nconvention international secretariats. Protected area data are aggregated globally into the World \nDatabase on Protected Areas by the UN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre, according \nto the mandate for production of the United Nations List of Protected Areas (Deguignet et al. 2014). They \nare disseminated through Protected Planet, which is jointly managed by UNEP-WCMC and IUCN and its \nWorld Commission on Protected Areas (Juffe-Bignoli et al. 2014). \n \nKey Biodiversity Areas are identified at national scales through multi-stakeholder processes, following \nstandard criteria and thresholds. Key Biodiversity Areas data are aggregated into the World Database on \nKey Biodiversity Areas, managed by BirdLife International. Specifically, data on Important Bird and \nBiodiversity Areas are available online at BirdLife International (2016) and data on Alliance for Zero \nExtinction sites are available online at AZE (2010). Both datasets, along with Key Biodiversity Areas \nidentified through other processes, are available through the World Database on Key Biodiversity Areas, \nand, along with the World Database on Protected Areas, are also disseminated through the Integrated \nBiodiversity Assessment Tool for Research and Conservation Planning.  \n \nCollection process: \nSee information under other sections. \n \n\n\f \n\nData Availability \n\nLast updated: 11 July 2017 \n\n \nDescription: \nThis indicator has been classified by the IAEG-SDGs as Tier 1. Current data are available for all countries in \nthe world, and these are updated on an ongoing basis. \n \nTime series: \n~150 years \n \nCalendar \n\n \nData collection: \nUNEP-WCMC produces the UN List of Protected Areas every 5–10 years, based on information provided \nby national ministries/agencies. In the intervening period between compilations of UN Lists, UNEP-WCMC \nworks closely with national ministries/agencies and NGOs responsible for the designation and \nmaintenance of protected areas, continually updating the WDPA as new data become available. The \nWorld Database of Key Biodiversity Areas is also updated on an ongoing basis, as new national data are \nsubmitted.  \n \nData release: \nThe indicator of protected area coverage of important sites for biodiversity is anticipated to be released \nannually. \n \nData providers \n\n \nProtected area data are compiled by ministries of environment and other ministries responsible for the \ndesignation and maintenance of protected areas.
