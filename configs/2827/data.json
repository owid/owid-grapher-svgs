Authors subtract work, school, home production, commuting, and personal care from total time available. \n\nThe authors assume commuting time is equal to 10 percent of work hours and school hours, and that personal care is 77 hours per week. For a discussion of the data behind these assumptions, see the Data Appendix in the paper by Ramey and Francis (2009) from which the data was taken.","createdAt":"2018-06-06T15:04:55.000Z","updatedAt":"2018-07-25T08:43:51.000Z","code":null,"coverage":"","timespan":"","datasetId":2800,"sourceId":15537,"shortUnit":null,"display":{},"columnOrder":0,"originalMetadata":null,"datasetName":"A Century of Work and Leisure - Ramey and Francis (2009)","s_id":15537,"s_name":"Ramey and Francis (2009)","source":{"id":15537,"name":"Ramey and Francis (2009)","dataPublishedBy":"Ramey, V.A. and Francis, N., 2009.
