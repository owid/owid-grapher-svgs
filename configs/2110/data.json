(See \nhttp://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm) \n \nGNI is obtained by DAC reporters from their national statistical offices. \n \n\n\f \n\nComments and limitations: \n \nData are available from 1960. \n \nMethodology \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\n \nComputation Method: \n \nNet ODA disbursements as a per cent of GNI. \n \nDisaggregation: \n \nThis indicator can be disaggregated by donor, recipient country, type of finance, type of aid, sub-sector, \netc. \n \nTreatment of missing values: \n \n\n•  At country level \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\n \nNone \n \n\n \nNone \n \n\nRegional aggregates: \n \nTotal net ODA as per cent of GNI is a total donor figure. \n \nSources of discrepancies: \n \nDAC statistics are standardized on a calendar year basis for all donors and may differ from fiscal year data \navailable in budget documents for some countries. \n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \n \nThe OECD/DAC has been collecting data on official and private resource flows from 1960 at an aggregate \nlevel and 1973 at an activity level through the Creditor Reporting System (CRS data are considered \ncomplete from 1995 for commitments at an activity level and 2002 for disbursements). \n \nThe data are reported by donors according to the same standards and methodologies (see here: \nhttp://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm). \n \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\nData are reported on an annual calendar year basis by statistical reporters in national administrations (aid \nagencies, Ministries of Foreign Affairs or Finance, etc. \n \nCollection process: \n \nA statistical reporter is responsible for the collection of DAC statistics in each providing country/agency. \nThis reporter is usually located in the national aid agency, Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Finance etc. \n \nData Availability \n\n \nOn a donor basis for all DAC countries and many non-DAC providers (bilateral and multilateral) that \nreport to the DAC. \n \nCalendar \n\n \nData collection: \n \nData are published on an annual basis in December for flows in the previous year.
