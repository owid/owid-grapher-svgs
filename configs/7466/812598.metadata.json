    "We count a war as ongoing in a region even if the war is also ongoing in other regions. The sum across all regions can therefore be higher than the total number of ongoing wars."

Such entities include governments of other types of geopolitical units (GPUs), such as dependencies or non-state autonomous entities, that do not meet the criteria of system membership. They also might involve nonterritorial entities (NTEs) or non-state armed groups (NSAs) that have no defined territorial base.\n\nYou can find more notes at https://correlatesofwar.org/wp-content/uploads/Non-StateWars_Codebook.pdf",

The primary attributes of Version 5.1 are that: it includes updated data on the intra-state wars from 1816-2014; and it includes wars that were omitted from the GUIDE due to publication errors. The dataset is composed of two files: Intra-state-Wars v.5.1.csv; and Intra‐state_state_participant_v5.1.csv. The first (Wars) provides summary information on each war, while the second file (state_participant) provides information on the war experience of each of the individual states involved.\n\nYou can find more notes at https://correlatesofwar.org/wp-content/uploads/Intra-StateWars_Codebook.pdf",
