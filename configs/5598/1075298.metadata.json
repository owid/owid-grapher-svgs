      "description": "There are 258 countries in the world. Greenland as separate from Denmark. Most users will want this file instead of sovereign states, though some users will want map units instead when distinguishing overseas regions of France.\n\nNatural Earth shows [de facto](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/about/disputed-boundaries-policy/) boundaries by default according to who controls the territory, versus de jure. Optional point-of-view (POV) variants are available for several dozen countries in the next section.\n\nCountries distinguish between metropolitan (homeland) and independent and semi-independent portions of sovereign states. If you want to see the dependent overseas regions broken out (like in ISO codes, see France for example), use [map units](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-political-vectors/10m-admin-0-details/) instead.\n\nEach country is coded with a world region that roughly follows the [United Nations setup](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm).\n\nCountries are coded with standard ISO and FIPS codes. French [INSEE codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INSEE) are also included.\n\nIncludes some thematic data from the United Nations, U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, and elsewhere.\n\nThis is the most detailed. Suitable for making zoomed-in maps of countries and regions. Show the world on a large wall poster:\n\n1:10,000,000\n1″ = 158 miles\n1 cm = 100 km\n\nAll users of Natural Earth are highly encouraged to read about data sources and manipulation in the [Data Creation section](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/about/data-creation/).",

The Uppsala\nConflict Data Program (UCDP) maintains a similar dataset from 1989, which is updated\nannually. For this dataset in different formats,\nas well as a codebook, go to the [UCDP Battle-Related Deaths Dataset](https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/).\n\nWhile the definitions are very similar, the coding practices may differ somewhat,\nand we generally recommend users of the two datasets to point out that these are\ntwo different, although closely related, datasets.",
