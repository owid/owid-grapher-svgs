    "additionalInfo": "The UCDP Battle-related Deaths Dataset provides data on direct deaths arising from 'state-based' conflicts.  UCDP defines state-based armed conflict as: “a contested incompatibility that concerns government and/or territory where the use of armed force between two parties, of which at least one is the government of a state, results in at least 25 battle-related deaths in a calendar year.”\n\nBoth civilian and military deaths are included. Deaths due to disease or famine caused by conflict, as well as extra-judicial killings in custody, are excluded.\n\nThe data is organised by year and conflict. We aggregate this to provide total numbers of deaths each year, broken down by the conflict type and region. \nThis dataset runs from 1989 and aims to have global coverage over this period. Accordingly, we add a zero deaths observation for year-region-conflict type combinations that do appear in the dataset.\n\nThe labels for the conflict types we have used paraphrase UCDP/PRIO's technical definitions of 'Extrasystemic', 'Internal', 'Internationalised internal' and 'Interstate'.\n\nNote that in this dataset the location refers not (necessarily) to where fighting and deaths took place, but rather to the location of the 'incompatibility' between the participants that defines the conflict: usually the country or territory whose possession or governance is in dispute.\n\nTo extend the data back further in time we rely on the PRIO Battledeaths Datset, produced according to the same definitions and structure as the UCDP Battle-related Deaths Dataset. The PRIO data runs from 1946 to 2008 and is no longer maintained. We aggregated the PRIO data in the same way as the UCDP data, and then constructed a final joint series which consists of the PRIO data from 1946 to 1988 and the UCDP data from 1989 onwards.\n\n\n"
