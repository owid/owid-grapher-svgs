    "additionalInfo": "The United States Election Project produces estimates of voter turnout among voting-age citizens in the United States for each presidential and midterm election since 1986 using survey data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) November Voting and Registration Supplement.\n\nThe CPS November Voting and Registration Supplement asks respondents whether they voted in the most recent election. The CPS surveys non-institutional households, which excludes military barracks, dorms, and prisons.\n\nNon-responses are excluded from the voter turnout estimates. To correct for over-reporting of voter turnout, the United States Election Project re-weights survey responses using the method proposed by Hur and Achen (2013). The survey weights are available at http://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/cps-methodology.\n\nCitations:\nHur, A., & Achen, C. H. (2013).
