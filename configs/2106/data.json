While the term ‘human rights advocate’ is broadly speaking a synonymous of ‘human \nrights defender,’ the latter is preferred as it is more consistent with internationally agreed human \nrights standards and established practice. \n\nThe different categories of violations tracked by the indicator have been defined in accordance \nwith international law and methodological standards and monitoring practices developed by the \nOHCHR and other international mechanisms and classified drawing on the International \nClassification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS) disseminated by the UN Office of Drugs and \nCrime (UNODC).

What distinguishes this \n\n3 \n\n\fLast updated: 08 June 2018 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nindicator from Indicator 16.1.1 (number of victims of intentional homicide per 100,000 population \nby sex and age) aside from the broader scope of violent incidents, is the motivation or causal \nfactor, i.e. that the violation was motivated by the victim having stood up to defend the rights of \nothers, exercise fundamental freedoms, or have occurred while the victim was engaged in such \nactivities. Alongside indicator 16.10.2 (number of countries that adopt and implement \nconstitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information) this indicator \nprovides both a micro and macro-level snapshot of the state of the aforementioned fundamental \nfreedoms in various contexts, as well as a link to the processes and structures required to meet \nhuman rights obligations with respect to those fundamental freedoms. \n\nConcepts: \n\nThe operational definitions of the cases, victims and other elements of the indicator have been \npatterned as far as practicable after corresponding categories in ICCS. The task of classifying cases \nentails observing events from both statistical standards and international law perspectives. For \nexample, intentional homicide (ICCS code 0101) is included as a component of the violation type \n‘killing’ and is in turn supplemented by applicable human rights standards: \n\n•  0101 Intentional homicide. Inclusions: murder; serious assault leading to death; femicide ; \n\nhonour killing; voluntary manslaughter; killings caused by excessive use of force by law \nenforcement officials; extrajudicial and extra-legal, summary or arbitrary executions. \n[human rights standards added in italics] \n\nThis conceptual approach is necessitated by the confluence of three factors. First is the principle \nthat all the violent acts tracked by the indicator are motivated by the exercise of fundamental \nfreedoms that are guaranteed by human rights law to all persons. Second, while human rights \nabuses are not always explicitly criminalized in domestic jurisdictions, ICCS has achieved a certain \nlevel of success in terms of integrating human rights elements in the classification of crimes. \nThird, irrespective of definitions provided by national legislation or practices, all events – whether \nordinary crimes or human rights violations – that meet the elements provided in the definitional \nframework will be counted for statistical purposes. \n\nComments and limitations: \n\nAs for other crime statistics and other statistics based on administrative sources, this indicator is \nsensitive to the completeness of reporting of individual events. There is a real but manageable \nrisk of underreporting. Moreover, reporting rates and statistical accuracy are influenced by \nvarious factors, including changes and biases in victim reporting behaviour, changes in police and \nrecording practices or rules, new laws, processing errors and non-responsive institutions. \nRegional and global aggregates may underestimate the true incidence and vol ume of \nvictimization, overcompensate for robust and inclusive national data collection systems . In most \ninstances, the number of cases reported will depend on the access to information, motivation and \nperseverance of national stakeholders, of human rights defenders themselves, and the \ncorresponding support of the international community. \n\n4 \n\n\fLast updated: 08 June 2018 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMethodology \n\nComputation Method: \n\nThe indicator is calculated as the total count of victims of reported incidents occurring within the \npreceding 12 months. \n\nDrawing on the ICCS, which is an incidents-based international classification system, the indicator \ncounts victims on the basis of cases of violations or abuses using a classification framework \ndeveloped for the purposes of the indicator. \n\nFor reporting purposes, the recorded offences will be ordered taking into account a hierarchy of \nviolations or abuses drawing on the “most serious offence” rule commonly applied in crime \nstatistics: \n\n1.  Killing \n2.  Torture \n3.  Enforced disappearance \n4.  Arbitrary detention \n5.  Kidnapping \n6.  Other harmful acts \n\nIf an incident incorporates elements of more than one category, it is coded to the higher \ncategory. Thus for an incident in which the victim was subjected to prolonged incommunicado \ndetention without medical access in the course of an unlawful detainment, the violation would be \ncounted under torture. \n\nDisaggregation: \n\nUsing the minimum data requirements, the indicator seeks to provide the following \ndisaggregation: \n\n•  Sex and Age groups \n•  Type of violation or abuse \n•  Perpetrator status, e.g. State actor vs non-State actors \n•  Geographic location of the incident \n\nIn some cases, desirable or additional data requirements may be used in order to show \nintersectionality and vulnerability within the main functional categories. Given sufficient dat a, for \nexample, the indicator may provide disaggregated data on specific groups of human rights \ndefenders according to the issues, peoples and communities they support which entail specific \nrisks and socio-legal barriers. \n\nWith proper data disaggregation, the impact of gender-based violence such as femicide can be \nquantified using this indicator. Moreover, additional data categories can also be added to show \nintersectionality and vulnerability and provide empirical evidence on differentiated risks and \n\n5 \n\n\fLast updated: 08 June 2018 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ndifficult contexts experienced by specific categories of human rights defenders , journalists or \ntrade unionists. This is because gender significantly influences the way they may experience risks \nand threats. Gender-based discrimination may also be influenced by other factors, such as race, \ndisability and other socially-constructed disadvantages. The intersection of these factors produces \ndifferent vulnerabilities. It would therefore be useful to compile available data on protected \ngrounds or the characteristics of an individual that should not be considered relevant to the \ndifferential treatment or enjoyment of a particular benefit. Disaggregation by the sexual \norientation and gender identity of victims, and by any other prohibited grounds of discrimination, \nshould be carried out in accordance with OHCHR guidance on a Human Rights-Based Approach to \nData. \n\nTreatment of missing values: \n\n  At country level\n\nEstimates will not be produced for missing values. \n\n  At regional and global levels\n\nEstimates will not be produced for missing values. \n\nRegional aggregates: \n\nSources of discrepancies: \n\nRegional aggregates will be produced but will not be estimated in respect of missing data. \n\nConsidering common challenges in the field of other crime statistics and administrative data \nsources, it is anticipated that the indicator will suffer from underreporting in some \ncountries/contexts. Global data providers rely on reports from national sources with varying \ncapacities to document incidents and to engage with international mechanisms. With the \ndevelopment of robust national data collection frameworks comprised of national human rights \ninstitutions, national statistical offices and civil society organizations supporting global data \ncollection, supported by capacity building programmes and a periodic assessment of relevant \nnetworks, it is expected that discrepancies will be mitigated gradually. \n\nWhile national data may still be compiled according to national legal systems rather than ICCS, \nOHCHR and its partner agencies will support UNODC as it undertakes special efforts to ensure the \ngradual implementation of ICCS by countries. Over time, this should help improve quality and \nconsistency of national and international data. \n\nData Sources \n\nDescription: \n\n \n\n6 \n\n\fLast updated: 08 June 2018 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nData will be collected from global, regional and national mandated bodies, mechanisms and \ninstitutions that generate and maintain administrative data whether in aggregated form or at \nmicro-level: \n\n•  Global mechanisms \n\no  OHCHR \n\n▪  Data from OHCHR monitoring work \n▪  Data from the work of the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council \n▪  Data from the Treaty Bodies reporting system \n▪  Press Releases and Statements of the UN High Commissioner for Human \n\n▪  Other reports and publications, such as the UN Secretary General’s Report \n\nRights \n\non Reprisals \n\n▪  Other mandated reports and publications \n\nJournalists Killings Condemned by the UNESCO Director General \n\n▪ \n▪  Other mandated reports and publications \n\no  UNESCO \n\no \n\nILO  \n\n▪  Cases reviewed by the Committee on Freedom of Association \n▪  Other mandated reports and publications \n\no Other UN agencies or entities producing relevant reports \n\n•  Regional mechanisms \n•  National mechanisms \n\no  National Human Rights Institutions \no  National monitoring and protection mechanisms for journalists, trade unionists \n\nand/or human rights defenders \n\no  Justice sector institutions such as Ministries of Justice, Interior etc \no  National Statistical Offices in their general role to coordinate national statistical \n\nsystems \n\nIntegration of data from all possible sources for this indicator will be made possible through the \nuse of standard definitions, data collection methods, reference period, counting units and \ncounting rules. \n\nCollection process: \n\nData will be compiled from administrative data produced by OHCHR, ILO, UNESCO and other UN \nagencies or entities in accordance with their respective mandates and procedures. \n\nFor example, with the support of OHCHR, the various Special Procedures of the UN Human Rights \nCouncil undertake country visits and act on individual cases by sending communications to States \nand occasionally, to non-State actors, in which they bring alleged violations or abuses to their \nattention for action, among other functions. Special Procedures report annually to the Human \nRights Council and the majority of the mandate-holders also report to the General Assembly. \nAccording to Section 40 of the Manual of Operations of Special Procedures, a decision to take \naction on a case or situation rests on the discretion of the mandate-holder. That discretion should \nbe exercised in light of the mandate entrusted to him or her as well as criteria generally relating \nto the reliability of the source; the credibility of information received; the details provid ed; and \n\n7 \n\n\fLast updated: 08 June 2018 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthe scope of the mandate. Every effort is made to determine the probable validity of alleged \nincidents and the reliability of the source before the special rapporteur makes contact with the \nGovernment of the State where the alleged abuse is thought to have occurred. Contact is usually \nconducted through an “urgent appeal” or “allegation” letter addressed to the State’s diplomatic \nmission with the United Nations in Geneva for transmission to capitals. These communications \nare used to ask the Government to take all appropriate action to investigate and address the \nalleged events and to communicate the results of its investigation and actions to the Special \nRapporteur. Communications as well as State replies are kept confidential until the end of the \nreporting period. The mandate-holder then reports these cases to the Human Rights Council or \nthe General Assembly. \n\nRegarding UNESCO’s statistics on the killings of journalists, UNESCO’s data on the killings of \njournalists corresponds to all of the cases of journalists’ killings that have been condemned by the \nUNESCO Director-General. These cases are identified based on reports from multiple sources, \nincluding from international, regional and local monitoring groups; UNESCO field offices; UNESCO \nPermanent Delegations; and other UN bodies. This follows the methodology requested by the \nIPDC Council through the 2012 IPDC Decision on the Safety of Journalists and the Issue of \nImpunity, which states that the report should be the result of “analysis and comparison o f \ninformation from a broad and diverse range of sources for the sake of ensuring objectivity, \nincluding updated information provided by the relevant Member States on a voluntary basis on \nthe killing of journalists, and non-responses, and be made widely available”. \n\nAs concerns the status of judicial enquiries into the killings of journalists, UNESCO’s data is based \nsolely on information provided by the Member States in which ki llings of journalists condemned \nby UNESCO’s Director-General have occurred. Each year, UNESCO sends out a letter to the \nPermanent Delegations of these Member States requesting them for an official update on the \njudicial follow-up to the cases of killed journalists. It is the Permanent Delegation’s responsibility \nto transfer the letter to the competent authorities at national level. On the basis of the \ninformation provided, UNESCO prepares the Director-General’s Report on the Safety of \nJournalists or the World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Report, \ndepending on the year. \n\nTo a large extent, these procedures are typical of monitoring mechanisms under international \nlaw. OHCHR, UNESCO, ILO and other agencies that are responsible for these mechanisms take \nparticular care to integrate in these standard operating procedures the requirement of \nconsultation with the Member States concerned. \n\nSimilarly, ILO is able to verify reported violations and abuses committed against trade unionists \nusing data from its stakeholders. \n\nAs a result of these processes, administrative data on violence against journalists, trade unionists \nand other human rights defenders are generated by international organizations. OHCHR will \ncompile and integrate the data using a common data management tool. \n\nIn the future, National Human Rights Institutions, National Statistical Offices, other government \nagencies as well as civil society organizations and networks will play an important role in the \ncollection of data. NHRIs, on the basis of their own mandate, are able to investigate cases of \n\n8 \n\n\fLast updated: 08 June 2018 \n\nviolations and abuses brought to their attention. Several NHRIs have also institutionalized the \nprovision of legal advice and other forms of support to victims of abuses who wish to access \ninternational mechanisms. NSOs, on the other hand, can complement this work by ensuring the \nimplementation of internationally-accepted statistical standards, including on data exchange and \ndissemination for this indicator. \n\nOHCHR, UNESCO and ILO will work jointly with national stakeholders to build capacity, harmonize \ndata collection procedures and produce globally comparable results. \n\nData Availability \n\nDescription: \n\n \n\nGlobal and regional aggregates on the component relating to the killing of journalists have \nalready been reported upon on an annual basis and included in the UN SDG progress reports. \nData on the killings of journalists is potentially covering all 195 Member States of UNESCO.

While the term ‘human rights advocate’ is broadly speaking a synonymous of ‘human \nrights defender,’ the latter is preferred as it is more consistent with internationally agreed human \nrights standards and established practice. \n\nThe different categories of violations tracked by the indicator have been defined in accordance \nwith international law and methodological standards and monitoring practices developed by the \nOHCHR and other international mechanisms and classified drawing on the International \nClassification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS) disseminated by the UN Office of Drugs and \nCrime (UNODC).

or while the victim was engaged in \nsuch activities; or by persons or groups not acting with the support or acquiescence of the \nState whose harmful acts were either motivated by the victim engaging in activities as a \njournalist, trade unionist or human rights defender, and/or met by a failure of due \ndiligence on the part of the State in responding to these harmful acts, such a failu re \nmotivated by the victim or associate engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or \nhuman rights defender;

What distinguishes this \n\n3 \n\n\fLast updated: 08 June 2018 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nindicator from Indicator 16.1.1 (number of victims of intentional homicide per 100,000 population \nby sex and age) aside from the broader scope of violent incidents, is the motivation or causal \nfactor, i.e. that the violation was motivated by the victim having stood up to defend the rights of \nothers, exercise fundamental freedoms, or have occurred while the victim was engaged in such \nactivities. Alongside indicator 16.10.2 (number of countries that adopt and implement \nconstitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information) this indicator \nprovides both a micro and macro-level snapshot of the state of the aforementioned fundamental \nfreedoms in various contexts, as well as a link to the processes and structures required to meet \nhuman rights obligations with respect to those fundamental freedoms. \n\nConcepts: \n\nThe operational definitions of the cases, victims and other elements of the indicator have been \npatterned as far as practicable after corresponding categories in ICCS. The task of classifying cases \nentails observing events from both statistical standards and international law perspectives. For \nexample, intentional homicide (ICCS code 0101) is included as a component of the violation type \n‘killing’ and is in turn supplemented by applicable human rights standards: \n\n•  0101 Intentional homicide. Inclusions: murder; serious assault leading to death; femicide ; \n\nhonour killing; voluntary manslaughter; killings caused by excessive use of force by law \nenforcement officials; extrajudicial and extra-legal, summary or arbitrary executions. \n[human rights standards added in italics] \n\nThis conceptual approach is necessitated by the confluence of three factors. First is the principle \nthat all the violent acts tracked by the indicator are motivated by the exercise of fundamental \nfreedoms that are guaranteed by human rights law to all persons. Second, while human rights \nabuses are not always explicitly criminalized in domestic jurisdictions, ICCS has achieved a certain \nlevel of success in terms of integrating human rights elements in the classification of crimes. \nThird, irrespective of definitions provided by national legislation or practices, all events – whether \nordinary crimes or human rights violations – that meet the elements provided in the definitional \nframework will be counted for statistical purposes. \n\nComments and limitations: \n\nAs for other crime statistics and other statistics based on administrative sources, this indicator is \nsensitive to the completeness of reporting of individual events. There is a real but manageable \nrisk of underreporting. Moreover, reporting rates and statistical accuracy are influenced by \nvarious factors, including changes and biases in victim reporting behaviour, changes in police and \nrecording practices or rules, new laws, processing errors and non-responsive institutions. \nRegional and global aggregates may underestimate the true incidence and vol ume of \nvictimization, overcompensate for robust and inclusive national data collection systems . In most \ninstances, the number of cases reported will depend on the access to information, motivation and \nperseverance of national stakeholders, of human rights defenders themselves, and the \ncorresponding support of the international community. \n\n4 \n\n\fLast updated: 08 June 2018 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMethodology \n\nComputation Method: \n\nThe indicator is calculated as the total count of victims of reported incidents occurring within the \npreceding 12 months. \n\nDrawing on the ICCS, which is an incidents-based international classification system, the indicator \ncounts victims on the basis of cases of violations or abuses using a classification framework \ndeveloped for the purposes of the indicator. \n\nFor reporting purposes, the recorded offences will be ordered taking into account a hierarchy of \nviolations or abuses drawing on the “most serious offence” rule commonly applied in crime \nstatistics: \n\n1.  Killing \n2.  Torture \n3.  Enforced disappearance \n4.  Arbitrary detention \n5.  Kidnapping \n6.  Other harmful acts \n\nIf an incident incorporates elements of more than one category, it is coded to the higher \ncategory. Thus for an incident in which the victim was subjected to prolonged incommunicado \ndetention without medical access in the course of an unlawful detainment, the violation would be \ncounted under torture. \n\nDisaggregation: \n\nUsing the minimum data requirements, the indicator seeks to provide the following \ndisaggregation: \n\n•  Sex and Age groups \n•  Type of violation or abuse \n•  Perpetrator status, e.g. State actor vs non-State actors \n•  Geographic location of the incident \n\nIn some cases, desirable or additional data requirements may be used in order to show \nintersectionality and vulnerability within the main functional categories. Given sufficient dat a, for \nexample, the indicator may provide disaggregated data on specific groups of human rights \ndefenders according to the issues, peoples and communities they support which entail specific \nrisks and socio-legal barriers. \n\nWith proper data disaggregation, the impact of gender-based violence such as femicide can be \nquantified using this indicator. Moreover, additional data categories can also be added to show \nintersectionality and vulnerability and provide empirical evidence on differentiated risks and \n\n5 \n\n\fLast updated: 08 June 2018 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ndifficult contexts experienced by specific categories of human rights defenders , journalists or \ntrade unionists. This is because gender significantly influences the way they may experience risks \nand threats. Gender-based discrimination may also be influenced by other factors, such as race, \ndisability and other socially-constructed disadvantages. The intersection of these factors produces \ndifferent vulnerabilities. It would therefore be useful to compile available data on protected \ngrounds or the characteristics of an individual that should not be considered relevant to the \ndifferential treatment or enjoyment of a particular benefit. Disaggregation by the sexual \norientation and gender identity of victims, and by any other prohibited grounds of discrimination, \nshould be carried out in accordance with OHCHR guidance on a Human Rights-Based Approach to \nData. \n\nTreatment of missing values: \n\n  At country level\n\nEstimates will not be produced for missing values. \n\n  At regional and global levels\n\nEstimates will not be produced for missing values. \n\nRegional aggregates: \n\nSources of discrepancies: \n\nRegional aggregates will be produced but will not be estimated in respect of missing data. \n\nConsidering common challenges in the field of other crime statistics and administrative data \nsources, it is anticipated that the indicator will suffer from underreporting in some \ncountries/contexts. Global data providers rely on reports from national sources with varying \ncapacities to document incidents and to engage with international mechanisms. With the \ndevelopment of robust national data collection frameworks comprised of national human rights \ninstitutions, national statistical offices and civil society organizations supporting global data \ncollection, supported by capacity building programmes and a periodic assessment of relevant \nnetworks, it is expected that discrepancies will be mitigated gradually. \n\nWhile national data may still be compiled according to national legal systems rather than ICCS, \nOHCHR and its partner agencies will support UNODC as it undertakes special efforts to ensure the \ngradual implementation of ICCS by countries. Over time, this should help improve quality and \nconsistency of national and international data. \n\nData Sources \n\nDescription: \n\n \n\n6 \n\n\fLast updated: 08 June 2018 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nData will be collected from global, regional and national mandated bodies, mechanisms and \ninstitutions that generate and maintain administrative data whether in aggregated form or at \nmicro-level: \n\n•  Global mechanisms \n\no  OHCHR \n\n▪  Data from OHCHR monitoring work \n▪  Data from the work of the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council \n▪  Data from the Treaty Bodies reporting system \n▪  Press Releases and Statements of the UN High Commissioner for Human \n\n▪  Other reports and publications, such as the UN Secretary General’s Report \n\nRights \n\non Reprisals \n\n▪  Other mandated reports and publications \n\nJournalists Killings Condemned by the UNESCO Director General \n\n▪ \n▪  Other mandated reports and publications \n\no  UNESCO \n\no \n\nILO  \n\n▪  Cases reviewed by the Committee on Freedom of Association \n▪  Other mandated reports and publications \n\no Other UN agencies or entities producing relevant reports \n\n•  Regional mechanisms \n•  National mechanisms \n\no  National Human Rights Institutions \no  National monitoring and protection mechanisms for journalists, trade unionists \n\nand/or human rights defenders \n\no  Justice sector institutions such as Ministries of Justice, Interior etc \no  National Statistical Offices in their general role to coordinate national statistical \n\nsystems \n\nIntegration of data from all possible sources for this indicator will be made possible through the \nuse of standard definitions, data collection methods, reference period, counting units and \ncounting rules. \n\nCollection process: \n\nData will be compiled from administrative data produced by OHCHR, ILO, UNESCO and other UN \nagencies or entities in accordance with their respective mandates and procedures. \n\nFor example, with the support of OHCHR, the various Special Procedures of the UN Human Rights \nCouncil undertake country visits and act on individual cases by sending communications to States \nand occasionally, to non-State actors, in which they bring alleged violations or abuses to their \nattention for action, among other functions. Special Procedures report annually to the Human \nRights Council and the majority of the mandate-holders also report to the General Assembly. \nAccording to Section 40 of the Manual of Operations of Special Procedures, a decision to take \naction on a case or situation rests on the discretion of the mandate-holder. That discretion should \nbe exercised in light of the mandate entrusted to him or her as well as criteria generally relating \nto the reliability of the source; the credibility of information received; the details provid ed; and \n\n7 \n\n\fLast updated: 08 June 2018 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthe scope of the mandate. Every effort is made to determine the probable validity of alleged \nincidents and the reliability of the source before the special rapporteur makes contact with the \nGovernment of the State where the alleged abuse is thought to have occurred. Contact is usually \nconducted through an “urgent appeal” or “allegation” letter addressed to the State’s diplomatic \nmission with the United Nations in Geneva for transmission to capitals. These communications \nare used to ask the Government to take all appropriate action to investigate and address the \nalleged events and to communicate the results of its investigation and actions to the Special \nRapporteur. Communications as well as State replies are kept confidential until the end of the \nreporting period. The mandate-holder then reports these cases to the Human Rights Council or \nthe General Assembly. \n\nRegarding UNESCO’s statistics on the killings of journalists, UNESCO’s data on the killings of \njournalists corresponds to all of the cases of journalists’ killings that have been condemned by the \nUNESCO Director-General. These cases are identified based on reports from multiple sources, \nincluding from international, regional and local monitoring groups; UNESCO field offices; UNESCO \nPermanent Delegations; and other UN bodies. This follows the methodology requested by the \nIPDC Council through the 2012 IPDC Decision on the Safety of Journalists and the Issue of \nImpunity, which states that the report should be the result of “analysis and comparison o f \ninformation from a broad and diverse range of sources for the sake of ensuring objectivity, \nincluding updated information provided by the relevant Member States on a voluntary basis on \nthe killing of journalists, and non-responses, and be made widely available”. \n\nAs concerns the status of judicial enquiries into the killings of journalists, UNESCO’s data is based \nsolely on information provided by the Member States in which ki llings of journalists condemned \nby UNESCO’s Director-General have occurred. Each year, UNESCO sends out a letter to the \nPermanent Delegations of these Member States requesting them for an official update on the \njudicial follow-up to the cases of killed journalists. It is the Permanent Delegation’s responsibility \nto transfer the letter to the competent authorities at national level. On the basis of the \ninformation provided, UNESCO prepares the Director-General’s Report on the Safety of \nJournalists or the World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Report, \ndepending on the year. \n\nTo a large extent, these procedures are typical of monitoring mechanisms under international \nlaw. OHCHR, UNESCO, ILO and other agencies that are responsible for these mechanisms take \nparticular care to integrate in these standard operating procedures the requirement of \nconsultation with the Member States concerned. \n\nSimilarly, ILO is able to verify reported violations and abuses committed against trade unionists \nusing data from its stakeholders. \n\nAs a result of these processes, administrative data on violence against journalists, trade unionists \nand other human rights defenders are generated by international organizations. OHCHR will \ncompile and integrate the data using a common data management tool. \n\nIn the future, National Human Rights Institutions, National Statistical Offices, other government \nagencies as well as civil society organizations and networks will play an important role in the \ncollection of data. NHRIs, on the basis of their own mandate, are able to investigate cases of \n\n8 \n\n\fLast updated: 08 June 2018 \n\nviolations and abuses brought to their attention. Several NHRIs have also institutionalized the \nprovision of legal advice and other forms of support to victims of abuses who wish to access \ninternational mechanisms. NSOs, on the other hand, can complement this work by ensuring the \nimplementation of internationally-accepted statistical standards, including on data exchange and \ndissemination for this indicator. \n\nOHCHR, UNESCO and ILO will work jointly with national stakeholders to build capacity, harmonize \ndata collection procedures and produce globally comparable results. \n\nData Availability \n\nDescription: \n\n \n\nGlobal and regional aggregates on the component relating to the killing of journalists have \nalready been reported upon on an annual basis and included in the UN SDG progress reports. \nData on the killings of journalists is potentially covering all 195 Member States of UNESCO.

While the term ‘human rights advocate’ is broadly speaking a synonymous of ‘human \nrights defender,’ the latter is preferred as it is more consistent with internationally agreed human \nrights standards and established practice. \n\nThe different categories of violations tracked by the indicator have been defined in accordance \nwith international law and methodological standards and monitoring practices developed by the \nOHCHR and other international mechanisms and classified drawing on the International \nClassification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS) disseminated by the UN Office of Drugs and \nCrime (UNODC).

or while the victim was engaged in \nsuch activities; or by persons or groups not acting with the support or acquiescence of the \nState whose harmful acts were either motivated by the victim engaging in activities as a \njournalist, trade unionist or human rights defender, and/or met by a failure of due \ndiligence on the part of the State in responding to these harmful acts, such a failu re \nmotivated by the victim or associate engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or \nhuman rights defender;

What distinguishes this \n\n3 \n\n\fLast updated: 08 June 2018 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nindicator from Indicator 16.1.1 (number of victims of intentional homicide per 100,000 population \nby sex and age) aside from the broader scope of violent incidents, is the motivation or causal \nfactor, i.e. that the violation was motivated by the victim having stood up to defend the rights of \nothers, exercise fundamental freedoms, or have occurred while the victim was engaged in such \nactivities. Alongside indicator 16.10.2 (number of countries that adopt and implement \nconstitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information) this indicator \nprovides both a micro and macro-level snapshot of the state of the aforementioned fundamental \nfreedoms in various contexts, as well as a link to the processes and structures required to meet \nhuman rights obligations with respect to those fundamental freedoms. \n\nConcepts: \n\nThe operational definitions of the cases, victims and other elements of the indicator have been \npatterned as far as practicable after corresponding categories in ICCS. The task of classifying cases \nentails observing events from both statistical standards and international law perspectives. For \nexample, intentional homicide (ICCS code 0101) is included as a component of the violation type \n‘killing’ and is in turn supplemented by applicable human rights standards: \n\n•  0101 Intentional homicide. Inclusions: murder; serious assault leading to death; femicide ; \n\nhonour killing; voluntary manslaughter; killings caused by excessive use of force by law \nenforcement officials; extrajudicial and extra-legal, summary or arbitrary executions. \n[human rights standards added in italics] \n\nThis conceptual approach is necessitated by the confluence of three factors. First is the principle \nthat all the violent acts tracked by the indicator are motivated by the exercise of fundamental \nfreedoms that are guaranteed by human rights law to all persons. Second, while human rights \nabuses are not always explicitly criminalized in domestic jurisdictions, ICCS has achieved a certain \nlevel of success in terms of integrating human rights elements in the classification of crimes. \nThird, irrespective of definitions provided by national legislation or practices, all events – whether \nordinary crimes or human rights violations – that meet the elements provided in the definitional \nframework will be counted for statistical purposes. \n\nComments and limitations: \n\nAs for other crime statistics and other statistics based on administrative sources, this indicator is \nsensitive to the completeness of reporting of individual events. There is a real but manageable \nrisk of underreporting. Moreover, reporting rates and statistical accuracy are influenced by \nvarious factors, including changes and biases in victim reporting behaviour, changes in police and \nrecording practices or rules, new laws, processing errors and non-responsive institutions. \nRegional and global aggregates may underestimate the true incidence and vol ume of \nvictimization, overcompensate for robust and inclusive national data collection systems . In most \ninstances, the number of cases reported will depend on the access to information, motivation and \nperseverance of national stakeholders, of human rights defenders themselves, and the \ncorresponding support of the international community. \n\n4 \n\n\fLast updated: 08 June 2018 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMethodology \n\nComputation Method: \n\nThe indicator is calculated as the total count of victims of reported incidents occurring within the \npreceding 12 months. \n\nDrawing on the ICCS, which is an incidents-based international classification system, the indicator \ncounts victims on the basis of cases of violations or abuses using a classification framework \ndeveloped for the purposes of the indicator. \n\nFor reporting purposes, the recorded offences will be ordered taking into account a hierarchy of \nviolations or abuses drawing on the “most serious offence” rule commonly applied in crime \nstatistics: \n\n1.  Killing \n2.  Torture \n3.  Enforced disappearance \n4.  Arbitrary detention \n5.  Kidnapping \n6.  Other harmful acts \n\nIf an incident incorporates elements of more than one category, it is coded to the higher \ncategory. Thus for an incident in which the victim was subjected to prolonged incommunicado \ndetention without medical access in the course of an unlawful detainment, the violation would be \ncounted under torture. \n\nDisaggregation: \n\nUsing the minimum data requirements, the indicator seeks to provide the following \ndisaggregation: \n\n•  Sex and Age groups \n•  Type of violation or abuse \n•  Perpetrator status, e.g. State actor vs non-State actors \n•  Geographic location of the incident \n\nIn some cases, desirable or additional data requirements may be used in order to show \nintersectionality and vulnerability within the main functional categories. Given sufficient dat a, for \nexample, the indicator may provide disaggregated data on specific groups of human rights \ndefenders according to the issues, peoples and communities they support which entail specific \nrisks and socio-legal barriers. \n\nWith proper data disaggregation, the impact of gender-based violence such as femicide can be \nquantified using this indicator. Moreover, additional data categories can also be added to show \nintersectionality and vulnerability and provide empirical evidence on differentiated risks and \n\n5 \n\n\fLast updated: 08 June 2018 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ndifficult contexts experienced by specific categories of human rights defenders , journalists or \ntrade unionists. This is because gender significantly influences the way they may experience risks \nand threats. Gender-based discrimination may also be influenced by other factors, such as race, \ndisability and other socially-constructed disadvantages. The intersection of these factors produces \ndifferent vulnerabilities. It would therefore be useful to compile available data on protected \ngrounds or the characteristics of an individual that should not be considered relevant to the \ndifferential treatment or enjoyment of a particular benefit. Disaggregation by the sexual \norientation and gender identity of victims, and by any other prohibited grounds of discrimination, \nshould be carried out in accordance with OHCHR guidance on a Human Rights-Based Approach to \nData. \n\nTreatment of missing values: \n\n  At country level\n\nEstimates will not be produced for missing values. \n\n  At regional and global levels\n\nEstimates will not be produced for missing values. \n\nRegional aggregates: \n\nSources of discrepancies: \n\nRegional aggregates will be produced but will not be estimated in respect of missing data. \n\nConsidering common challenges in the field of other crime statistics and administrative data \nsources, it is anticipated that the indicator will suffer from underreporting in some \ncountries/contexts. Global data providers rely on reports from national sources with varying \ncapacities to document incidents and to engage with international mechanisms. With the \ndevelopment of robust national data collection frameworks comprised of national human rights \ninstitutions, national statistical offices and civil society organizations supporting global data \ncollection, supported by capacity building programmes and a periodic assessment of relevant \nnetworks, it is expected that discrepancies will be mitigated gradually. \n\nWhile national data may still be compiled according to national legal systems rather than ICCS, \nOHCHR and its partner agencies will support UNODC as it undertakes special efforts to ensure the \ngradual implementation of ICCS by countries. Over time, this should help improve quality and \nconsistency of national and international data. \n\nData Sources \n\nDescription: \n\n \n\n6 \n\n\fLast updated: 08 June 2018 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nData will be collected from global, regional and national mandated bodies, mechanisms and \ninstitutions that generate and maintain administrative data whether in aggregated form or at \nmicro-level: \n\n•  Global mechanisms \n\no  OHCHR \n\n▪  Data from OHCHR monitoring work \n▪  Data from the work of the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council \n▪  Data from the Treaty Bodies reporting system \n▪  Press Releases and Statements of the UN High Commissioner for Human \n\n▪  Other reports and publications, such as the UN Secretary General’s Report \n\nRights \n\non Reprisals \n\n▪  Other mandated reports and publications \n\nJournalists Killings Condemned by the UNESCO Director General \n\n▪ \n▪  Other mandated reports and publications \n\no  UNESCO \n\no \n\nILO  \n\n▪  Cases reviewed by the Committee on Freedom of Association \n▪  Other mandated reports and publications \n\no Other UN agencies or entities producing relevant reports \n\n•  Regional mechanisms \n•  National mechanisms \n\no  National Human Rights Institutions \no  National monitoring and protection mechanisms for journalists, trade unionists \n\nand/or human rights defenders \n\no  Justice sector institutions such as Ministries of Justice, Interior etc \no  National Statistical Offices in their general role to coordinate national statistical \n\nsystems \n\nIntegration of data from all possible sources for this indicator will be made possible through the \nuse of standard definitions, data collection methods, reference period, counting units and \ncounting rules. \n\nCollection process: \n\nData will be compiled from administrative data produced by OHCHR, ILO, UNESCO and other UN \nagencies or entities in accordance with their respective mandates and procedures. \n\nFor example, with the support of OHCHR, the various Special Procedures of the UN Human Rights \nCouncil undertake country visits and act on individual cases by sending communications to States \nand occasionally, to non-State actors, in which they bring alleged violations or abuses to their \nattention for action, among other functions. Special Procedures report annually to the Human \nRights Council and the majority of the mandate-holders also report to the General Assembly. \nAccording to Section 40 of the Manual of Operations of Special Procedures, a decision to take \naction on a case or situation rests on the discretion of the mandate-holder. That discretion should \nbe exercised in light of the mandate entrusted to him or her as well as criteria generally relating \nto the reliability of the source; the credibility of information received; the details provid ed; and \n\n7 \n\n\fLast updated: 08 June 2018 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthe scope of the mandate. Every effort is made to determine the probable validity of alleged \nincidents and the reliability of the source before the special rapporteur makes contact with the \nGovernment of the State where the alleged abuse is thought to have occurred. Contact is usually \nconducted through an “urgent appeal” or “allegation” letter addressed to the State’s diplomatic \nmission with the United Nations in Geneva for transmission to capitals. These communications \nare used to ask the Government to take all appropriate action to investigate and address the \nalleged events and to communicate the results of its investigation and actions to the Special \nRapporteur. Communications as well as State replies are kept confidential until the end of the \nreporting period. The mandate-holder then reports these cases to the Human Rights Council or \nthe General Assembly. \n\nRegarding UNESCO’s statistics on the killings of journalists, UNESCO’s data on the killings of \njournalists corresponds to all of the cases of journalists’ killings that have been condemned by the \nUNESCO Director-General. These cases are identified based on reports from multiple sources, \nincluding from international, regional and local monitoring groups; UNESCO field offices; UNESCO \nPermanent Delegations; and other UN bodies. This follows the methodology requested by the \nIPDC Council through the 2012 IPDC Decision on the Safety of Journalists and the Issue of \nImpunity, which states that the report should be the result of “analysis and comparison o f \ninformation from a broad and diverse range of sources for the sake of ensuring objectivity, \nincluding updated information provided by the relevant Member States on a voluntary basis on \nthe killing of journalists, and non-responses, and be made widely available”. \n\nAs concerns the status of judicial enquiries into the killings of journalists, UNESCO’s data is based \nsolely on information provided by the Member States in which ki llings of journalists condemned \nby UNESCO’s Director-General have occurred. Each year, UNESCO sends out a letter to the \nPermanent Delegations of these Member States requesting them for an official update on the \njudicial follow-up to the cases of killed journalists. It is the Permanent Delegation’s responsibility \nto transfer the letter to the competent authorities at national level. On the basis of the \ninformation provided, UNESCO prepares the Director-General’s Report on the Safety of \nJournalists or the World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Report, \ndepending on the year. \n\nTo a large extent, these procedures are typical of monitoring mechanisms under international \nlaw. OHCHR, UNESCO, ILO and other agencies that are responsible for these mechanisms take \nparticular care to integrate in these standard operating procedures the requirement of \nconsultation with the Member States concerned. \n\nSimilarly, ILO is able to verify reported violations and abuses committed against trade unionists \nusing data from its stakeholders. \n\nAs a result of these processes, administrative data on violence against journalists, trade unionists \nand other human rights defenders are generated by international organizations. OHCHR will \ncompile and integrate the data using a common data management tool. \n\nIn the future, National Human Rights Institutions, National Statistical Offices, other government \nagencies as well as civil society organizations and networks will play an important role in the \ncollection of data. NHRIs, on the basis of their own mandate, are able to investigate cases of \n\n8 \n\n\fLast updated: 08 June 2018 \n\nviolations and abuses brought to their attention. Several NHRIs have also institutionalized the \nprovision of legal advice and other forms of support to victims of abuses who wish to access \ninternational mechanisms. NSOs, on the other hand, can complement this work by ensuring the \nimplementation of internationally-accepted statistical standards, including on data exchange and \ndissemination for this indicator. \n\nOHCHR, UNESCO and ILO will work jointly with national stakeholders to build capacity, harmonize \ndata collection procedures and produce globally comparable results. \n\nData Availability \n\nDescription: \n\n \n\nGlobal and regional aggregates on the component relating to the killing of journalists have \nalready been reported upon on an annual basis and included in the UN SDG progress reports. \nData on the killings of journalists is potentially covering all 195 Member States of UNESCO.
