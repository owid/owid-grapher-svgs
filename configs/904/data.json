In the 2010 book, the authors analyze the long term evolution of top incomes in 12 new countries (after the 10 initial countries analysed in the 2007 book). The results presented in the books and the website have considerably renewed our knowledge of the long run dynamics of inequality. In particular, they radically question Kuznets' optimistic hypothesis on the interplay between economic development and the distribution of income."}}},"entityKey":{"2":{"name":"Ireland","code":"IRL"},"3":{"name":"France","code":"FRA"},"5":{"name":"Netherlands","code":"NLD"},"6":{"name":"Germany","code":"DEU"},"7":{"name":"Switzerland","code":"CHE"},"8":{"name":"Italy","code":"ITA"},"9":{"name":"Spain","code":"ESP"},"10":{"name":"Sweden","code":"SWE"},"13":{"name":"United States","code":"USA"},"14":{"name":"Japan","code":"JPN"},"23":{"name":"Australia","code":"AUS"},"44":{"name":"Canada","code":"CAN"},"63":{"name":"Uruguay","code":"URY"},"86":{"name":"Singapore","code":"SGP"},"95":{"name":"Portugal","code":"PRT"},"102":{"name":"Norway","code":"NOR"},"116":{"name":"Malaysia","code":"MYS"},"171":{"name":"China","code":"CHN"},"198":{"name":"Taiwan","code":"TWN"},"213":{"name":"Mauritius","code":"MUS"},"3894":{"name":"Korea, South","code":null},"34708":{"name":"France (pre 1962)","code":null}}}
