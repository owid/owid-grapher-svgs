Data is based on best estimates: there is greater uncertainty in earlier historical data but is provided as the best estimate of the time. \n\nThe main data source for rhino populations is the African and Asian Rhino Specialist Groups (AfRSG). AfRSG periodically produce the latest estimates of rhino populations in Africa and Asia, in update reports of their status. The available literature from AfRSG can be accessed at: http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/index.php?s=1&act=refs.\n\nCitation of the latest report is as follows:\nEmslie, R.H. et al., 2019.
