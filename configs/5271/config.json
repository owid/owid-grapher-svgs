        "content": "Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas, but not the only one. To capture all greenhouse gas emissions, researchers express them in ‘carbon dioxide-equivalents' (CO₂eq). This takes all greenhouse gases into account, not just CO₂.\n\nTo express all greenhouse gases in carbon dioxide-equivalents (CO₂eq), each one is weighted by its global warming potential (GWP) value. GWP measures the amount of warming a gas creates compared to CO₂. CO₂ is given a GWP value of one. If a gas had a GWP of 10 then one kilogram of that gas would generate ten times the warming effect as one kilogram of CO₂. \n\nCarbon dioxide-equivalents are calculated for each gas by multiplying the mass of emissions of a specific greenhouse gas by its GWP factor.\n\nThis warming can be stated over different timescales. To calculate CO₂eq over 100 years, we’d multiply each gas by its GWP over a 100-year timescale (GWP100).\n\nTotal greenhouse gas emissions – measured in CO₂eq – are then calculated by summing each gas’ CO₂eq value.",
