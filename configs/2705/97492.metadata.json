  "description": "The adult literacy rate is defined as the percentage of survey respondents, aged 15 and above, who can read. \n\nVariable (M)V155 has been used to calculate literacy rates. The 155 literacy variable indicates whether a respondent who attended primary schooling can read a whole or part of a sentence showed. A respondent who attended secondary education or higher are coded 2 as well as respondent who could read a whole sentence. Possible categories include: 0 - cannot read at all; 1 - able to read only parts of sentence; 2 - able to read whole sentence; 3 - no card with required language; 4 - blind/visually impaired. Our estimates exclude those in categories 3 and 4. \n\nThe adult literacy rate has been calculated as the total number of respondents who are in categories 1 or 2, divided by the total number of respondents by country, per year.",

    "additionalInfo": "The adult literacy rate is defined as the percentage of survey respondents, aged 15 and above, who can read. The 155 literacy variable indicates whether a respondent who attended primary schooling can read a whole or part of a sentence showed. A respondent who attended secondary education or higher are coded 2 as well as respondent who could read a whole sentence. Possible categories include: 0 - cannot read at all; 1 - able to read only parts of sentence; 2 - able to read whole sentence; 3 - no card with required language; 4 - blind/visually impaired. Our estimates exclude those in categories 3 and 4. \n\nThe methodology for constructing this variable is as follows:\n<ul>\n<li>The DHS surveys for men and women were pooled</li>\n<li>Created a dichotomous literacy variable, combining categories 1 'able to read only parts of sentence' with 2 'able to read whole sentence' to represent literate respondents, and 0 'cannot read at all' for illiterate respondents</li>\n<li>Summed the total number of respondents who were classified as literate and the total number of respondents, for each country in each year</li>\n<li>Calculated the literacy rate (% of total respondents) = (number of people in category 1 and 2 / number of respondents) * 100 </li>\n<li>Calculated the female literacy rate (% of total respondents) = (number of females in category 1 and 2 / number of respondents) * 100 </li>\n<li>Calculated the male literacy rate (% of total respondents) = (number of males in category 1 and 2 / number of respondents) * 100 </li>\n</ul>\n\nThe number of survey respondents varies from country-to-country and year-to-year. Therefore, comparisons across countries should be made with caution. \n\nDHS surveys are conducted approximately every 5 years in phases. The literacy variable (155) is available from phase 4 onward. Hence, Phase 7 corresponds to 2015; phase 6 to 2010; phase 5 to 2005; and phase 4 to 2000.  As this dataset brings together a number of countries across various phases, the year has been assigned according to the survey phase. Note the actual year the survey was conducted in a country may differ to the year assigned, but the survey will have been undertaken within the five year interval between each phase. \n\nFor further information on the DHS surveys visit: https://dhsprogram.com/data/"
