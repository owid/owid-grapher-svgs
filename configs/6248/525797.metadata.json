  "description": "According to the AI Index: \"Computing Research Association (CRA) members are 200-plus North American organizations active in computing research: academic departments of computer science and computer engineering; laboratories and centers in industry, government, and academia; and affiliated professional societies (AAAI, ACM, CACS/AIC, IEEE Computer Society, SIAM USENIX). CRA’s mission is to enhance innovation by joining with industry, government, and academia to strengthen research and advanced education in computing.\"\n\nThis data is from CRA's Taulbee Survey, which they conduct during the fall of each academic year by reaching out to over 200 PhD-granting departments.
