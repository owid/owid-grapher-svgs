One of the targets is: “Substantially increase the \nnumber of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies by 2020”. \nIn line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, disaster risk reduction \nstrategies and policies should mainstream and integrate disaster risk reduction within and across all \nsectors, across different timescales and with targets, indicators and time frames. These strategies should \nbe aimed at preventing the creation of disaster risk, the reduction of existing risk and the strengthening \nof economic, social, health and environmental resilience. \n \nThe open-ended intergovernmental expert working group on indicators and terminology relating to \ndisaster risk reduction (OIEWG) established by the General Assembly (resolution 69/284) has developed a \nset of indicators to measure global progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework, which was \nendorsed by the UNGA (OIEWG report A/71/644). The relevant SDG indicators reflect the Sendai \nFramework indicators. \n\nRationale: \nIncreasing the proportion of local governments that adopt and implement local disaster risk reduction \nstrategies, which the Sendai Framework calls for, will contribute to sustainable development and \nstrengthen economic, social, health and environmental resilience. Their economic, environmental and \nsocial perspectives would include poverty eradication, urban resilience, and climate change adaptation. \n\nComments and limitations: \n\n \nThe Hyogo Framework for Action Monitor (HFA Monitor) started in 2007 and over time, the number of \ncountries reporting to UNISDR increased from 60 in 2007 to approximately 100 countries in 2015 \nundertaking voluntary self-assessment of progress in implementing the HFA. During the four reporting \ncycles the HFA Monitor has generated the world’s largest repository of information on national disaster \nrisk reduction policy inter alia. In 2018 the Sendai Framework Monitor system will launch and all Member \nStates are expected to report data of the previous year(s).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fLast updated: February 2018 \n\n \nMethodology \n\nComputation Method: \nMember States count the number of local governments that adopt and implement local DRR strategies in \nline with the national strategy and express it as a percentage of the total number of local governments in \nthe country. \n \nLocal governments are determined by the reporting country for this indicator, considering sub-national \npublic administrations with responsibility to develop local disaster risk reduction strategies. It is \nrecommended that countries report on progress made by the lowest level of government accorded the \nmandate for disaster risk reduction, as the Sendai Framework promotes the adoption and \nimplementation of local disaster risk reduction strategies in every local authority. \n \nEach Member State will calculate the ratio of the number of local governments with local DRR strategies \nin line with national strategies and the total number of local governments. \n \nGlobal Average will then be calculated as below through arithmetic average of the data from each \nMember State. \n \n Further information of the methodology can be obtained in the Technical Guidance (see reference). \n \n\nDisaggregation: \n\nBy country \n\nBy local government (applying sub-national administrative unit) \n\nIf a country does not report (missing Value), it will be considered to be 0 or null as same as the HFA \n\nTreatment of missing values: \n\n•  At country level \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\nMonitor. \n\n \n\n \n\nNA \n\nRegional aggregates: \n\nSources of discrepancies: \n\nIt could be calculated as an arithmetic average of reports by Member States. \n\nN/A (There is no global database collecting DRR policy information besides the HFA Monitor and the \n\nsucceeding Sendai Framework Monitor.) \n\n \nMethods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fLast updated: February 2018 \n\n•  Technical guidance for monitoring and reporting on progress in achieving the global targets of the \n\nSendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction  \nhttp://www.preventionweb.net/events/view/55594   \n(The latest version will be uploaded on this site in early November) \n\n•  Description of practices and guidelines for quality assurance followed at your agency.  \n\n•  UNISDR Regional Office will have a regular contact with National Sendai Framework Focal Points \n\nDescription: \n\nSendai Framework Monitor, reported to UNISDR \n\nThe national Sendai Framework Focal Points will compile all inputs from their line ministries, NSO, and \n\nother entities, if appropriate, and report through the Sendai Framework Monitoring System. \n\nUNISDR conducted the Sendai Framework Data Readiness Review which 87 Member States responded \n\nbetween February and April in 2017.  \n\nIn Q1 2018 all Member States will be invited to start reporting.
