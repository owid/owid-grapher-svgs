These results differ significantly from UN and nationally-defined figures based on differences in methodology.\n\nThe European Commission combines high-resolution satellite imagery with national census data to derive its estimates of urban and rural settlements.\n\nThe European Commission applied a universal definition of settlements across all countries:\n\n- Urban centre: must have a minimum of 50,000 inhabitants plus a population density of at least 1500 people per square kilometre (km2) or density of build-up area greater than 50 percent.\n- Urban cluster: must have a minimum of 5,000 inhabitants plus a population density of at least 300 people per square kilometre (km2).\n- Rural: fewer than 5,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe urban share is thereafter defined as the sum of urban centres and urban clusters."
