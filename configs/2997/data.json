These results differ significantly from UN and nationally-defined figures based on differences in methodology.\n\nThe European Commission combines high-resolution satellite imagery with national census data to derive its estimates of urban and rural settlements.\n\nThe European Commission applied a universal definition of settlements across all countries:\n\n- Urban centre: must have a minimum of 50,000 inhabitants plus a population density of at least 1500 people per square kilometre (km2) or density of build-up area greater than 50 percent.\n- Urban cluster: must have a minimum of 5,000 inhabitants plus a population density of at least 300 people per square kilometre (km2).\n- Rural: fewer than 5,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe urban share is thereafter defined as the sum of urban centres and urban clusters."}}},"entityKey":{"273":{"name":"Africa","code":null},"275":{"name":"Asia","code":null},"276":{"name":"Europe","code":null},"277":{"name":"Oceania","code":null},"294":{"name":"North America","code":null},"355":{"name":"World","code":"OWID_WRL"},"33415":{"name":"Latin America & the Caribbean","code":null}}}
