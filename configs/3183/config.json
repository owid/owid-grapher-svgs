  "subtitle": "The number of live births in England and Wales at or below 22 weeks of gestation. 23 weeks is typically defined at the threshold of extreme viability for survival. Although survival of infants at 22 to 23 weeks gestation is no longer exceptional, mortality rates are high. In 2015, one-third of infants born at 22 to 23 weeks of gestation survived. Data for live births in such an early period of gestation was generally not recorded in statistical summaries prior to 2014.",
