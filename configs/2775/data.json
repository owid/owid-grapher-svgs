        "additionalInfo": "Last updated: 21 July 2017 \n\n \n \nGoal 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and \ndecent work for all  \nTarget 8.7: Take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human \ntrafficking and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, including recruitment \nand use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labour in all its forms  \nIndicator 8.7.1: Proportion and number of children aged 5-17 years engaged in child labour, by sex and age  \n \nInstitutional information  \n\n \nOrganization(s):  \n \nUnited Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)  \nInternational Labour Organization (ILO) \n \nConcepts and definitions  \n\n \nDefinition:  \n \nThe number of children engaged in child labour corresponds to the number of children reported to be in child \nlabour during the reference period (usually the week prior to the survey). The proportion of children in child \nlabour is calculated as the number of children in child labour divided by the total number of children in the \npopulation.  For the purposes of this indicator, children include all persons aged 5 to 17. This indicator is \ndisaggregated by sex and age group (age bands 5-14 and 15-17) \n \nRationale:  \n \nFar too many children in the world remain trapped in child labour, compromising their individual future. \nAccording to the latest ILO global estimates, about 168 million children worldwide are child labourers, \naccounting for almost 11 percent of the child population.  These stark figures underscore the need for \naccelerated progress against child labour in the lead up to the 2025 target date, and the accompanying need for \nchild labour statistics to monitor and guide efforts in this regard.  Reliable, comprehensive and timely data on \nthe nature and extent of child labour provide a basis for determining priorities for national global action against \nchild labour. Statistical information on child labour, and more broadly on all working children, also provide a \nbasis for increasing public awareness of the situation of working children and for the development of \nappropriate regulatory frameworks and policies. \n \nConcepts:  \n \nThe term child labour refers to the subset of children’s activities that is injurious, negative or undesirable to \nchildren and that should be targeted for elimination. Child labour is a legal concept rather than a statistical one, \nand the international legal standards that define it are therefore the necessary frame of reference for child \nlabour statistics. The three principal international conventions on child labour – ILO Convention No. 138 \n(Minimum Age) (C138), ILO Convention No. 182 (Worst Forms) (C182), and the United Nations Convention on \nthe Rights of the Child (CRC), together set the legal boundaries for child labour, and provide the legal basis for \nnational and international actions against it. \n\n\fLast updated: 21 July 2017 \n\n \n \n \nIn December 2008, the International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) adopted the Resolution concerning \nstatistics of child labour. This Resolution helps in translating the legal standards governing child labour into \nstatistical terms. In particular, the Resolution is designed to set standards for the collection, compilation and \nanalysis of national child labour statistics, and to guide countries in updating their existing statistical system in \nthis field. \n \nIn accordance with the Resolution, and on the basis of the production boundary set by the United Nations \nSystem of National Accounts (SNA), child labour is defined for measurement purposes to include all persons \naged 5 to 17 years who are engaged in one or more of the following activities during a specified time period:  \n\n•  hazardous work (18th ICLS, paragraphs 21 to 32);  \n•  worst forms of child labour other than hazardous work (18th ICLS, paragraphs 33 to 34); and  \n•  employment below the minimum working age, excluding, where applicable, “light work”, performed by \n\nchildren aged not less than 12 or 13 years  (18th ICLS, paragraphs 35 to 37).  \n \n\nIf, depending upon national policies and circumstances, the general production boundary rather than the SNA \nproduction boundary is used for measuring productive activities by children, child labour will include, in addition \nto these three categories, hazardous unpaid household services. For the sake of clarity, child labour estimated \non this basis should be called “child labour (general production boundary basis)”. \nThe measurement methodology used by the ILO in its global estimates on child labour,1 building on the ICLS \nstatistical definition, classifies child labour on the basis of the following criteria:  \n\n•  Ages 5 to 11: at least 1 hour of economic activity per week;  \n•  Ages 12 to 14: at least 14 hour of economic activity per week in all forms of economic activity except \n\npermissible “light” work, where light work is operationally defined as economic activity that (i) does not \nexceed 14 hours per week and that (ii) is not hazardous in nature; and \n\n•  Ages 15 to 17: work in designated hazardous industries, or in designated hazardous occupations, or for \n\nlong hours. Long hours are defined as 43 or more hours during the reference week. \n\n \nComments and limitations:  \nChild labour estimates based on the statistical standards set out in the ICLS resolution represent useful \nbenchmarks for international comparative purposes but are not necessarily consistent with estimates based on \nnational child labour legislation. ILO Convention No. 138 contains a number of flexibility clauses left to the \ndiscretion of the competent national authority in consultation (where relevant) with workers’ and employers’ \norganizations (e.g., minimum ages, scope of application).2 This means that there is no single legal definition of \nchild labour across countries, and thus, no single statistical measure of child labour consistent with national \nlegislation across countries. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                           \n1 ILO-IPEC. Marking progress against child labour - Global estimates and trends 2000-2012 / International Labour Office, International \nProgramme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) - Geneva: ILO, 2013. \n2  Principal  areas  of  flexibility  in  the  Convention  include:  (a)minimum  ages:  Members  whose  economy  and  educational  facilities  are \ninsufficiently developed may specify a lower general minimum age of 14 years (Art. 2.4) and a lower age range for light work of 12 to 14 \nyears  (Art  7.4);  and  (b)  scope  of  application:  Members  may  exclude  from  the  application  of  the  Convention  limited  (non-hazardous) \ncategories of employment or work in respect of which special and substantial problems of application arise (Art. 4.1). Members whose \neconomy and administrative facilities are insufficiently developed may also initially limit the scope of application of the Convention (Art. \n5.1) beyond a core group of economic activities or undertakings (Art. 5.3). \n\n\f \n \nMethodology  \n\nLast updated: 21 July 2017 \n\nComputation Method:  \n \nChildren aged 5-17: Number of children aged 5-17 reported in child labour during the week prior to the survey \ndivided by the total number of children aged 5-17 in the population, multiplied by 100.  \n \nChildren aged 5-14: Number of children aged 5-14 reported in child labour during the week prior to the survey \ndivided by the total number of children aged 5-14 in the population, multiplied by 100.  \n \nChildren aged 15-17: Number of children aged 15-17 reported child labour during the week prior to the survey \ndivided by the total number of children aged 15-17 in the population, multiplied by 100.  \n \nDisaggregation:  \n \nSex and age.  \n \nData Sources  \n\n \nDescription:  \n \nHousehold surveys such as National Labour Force Surveys, National Multipurpose Household Surveys, UNICEF-\nsupported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), ILO-supported \nStatistical Information and Monitoring Programme on Child Labour (SIMPOC), and World bank Living Standard \nMeasurement surveys (LSMS) are among the most important instruments for generating information on child \nlabour in developing countries. Estimates of child labour incidence generated by these survey instruments are \nincreasingly relied on by countries to monitor progress towards national and global child labour elimination \ntargets. Many countries also produce national labour estimates and reports that often include data on child \nlabour and/or employment among children.  \n \nData Availability  \n\n \nNationally representative and comparable data are currently available for 102 low-and middle-income countries. \n  \nCalendar \n\n \n NA  \n \nData providers  \n\n \nNational Statistical Offices (for the most part) and line ministries/other government agencies and International \nagencies that have conducted labour force surveys or other household surveys through which data on child \nlabour were collected.  \n\n\fLast updated: 21 July 2017 \n\n \n \n \nData compilers  \n\n \nUNICEF and ILO  \n \nReferences  \n\n \nURL:  \ndata.unicef.org   \n\nhttp://www.ilo.org/ipec/ChildlabourstatisticsSIMPOC/Questionnairessurveysandreports/lang--\nen/index.htm  \n\nwww.ucw-project.org  \n\nReferences:  \nhttp://data.unicef.org/child-protection/child-labour.html  \n\nhttp://www.ilo.org/ipec/ChildlabourstatisticsSIMPOC/lang--en/index.htm  \n\nwww.ucw-project.org  \n\n \n\n\f"

        "additionalInfo": "Last updated: 21 July 2017 \n\n \n \nGoal 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and \ndecent work for all  \nTarget 8.7: Take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human \ntrafficking and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, including recruitment \nand use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labour in all its forms  \nIndicator 8.7.1: Proportion and number of children aged 5-17 years engaged in child labour, by sex and age  \n \nInstitutional information  \n\n \nOrganization(s):  \n \nUnited Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)  \nInternational Labour Organization (ILO) \n \nConcepts and definitions  \n\n \nDefinition:  \n \nThe number of children engaged in child labour corresponds to the number of children reported to be in child \nlabour during the reference period (usually the week prior to the survey). The proportion of children in child \nlabour is calculated as the number of children in child labour divided by the total number of children in the \npopulation.  For the purposes of this indicator, children include all persons aged 5 to 17. This indicator is \ndisaggregated by sex and age group (age bands 5-14 and 15-17) \n \nRationale:  \n \nFar too many children in the world remain trapped in child labour, compromising their individual future. \nAccording to the latest ILO global estimates, about 168 million children worldwide are child labourers, \naccounting for almost 11 percent of the child population.  These stark figures underscore the need for \naccelerated progress against child labour in the lead up to the 2025 target date, and the accompanying need for \nchild labour statistics to monitor and guide efforts in this regard.  Reliable, comprehensive and timely data on \nthe nature and extent of child labour provide a basis for determining priorities for national global action against \nchild labour. Statistical information on child labour, and more broadly on all working children, also provide a \nbasis for increasing public awareness of the situation of working children and for the development of \nappropriate regulatory frameworks and policies. \n \nConcepts:  \n \nThe term child labour refers to the subset of children’s activities that is injurious, negative or undesirable to \nchildren and that should be targeted for elimination. Child labour is a legal concept rather than a statistical one, \nand the international legal standards that define it are therefore the necessary frame of reference for child \nlabour statistics. The three principal international conventions on child labour – ILO Convention No. 138 \n(Minimum Age) (C138), ILO Convention No. 182 (Worst Forms) (C182), and the United Nations Convention on \nthe Rights of the Child (CRC), together set the legal boundaries for child labour, and provide the legal basis for \nnational and international actions against it. \n\n\fLast updated: 21 July 2017 \n\n \n \n \nIn December 2008, the International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) adopted the Resolution concerning \nstatistics of child labour. This Resolution helps in translating the legal standards governing child labour into \nstatistical terms. In particular, the Resolution is designed to set standards for the collection, compilation and \nanalysis of national child labour statistics, and to guide countries in updating their existing statistical system in \nthis field. \n \nIn accordance with the Resolution, and on the basis of the production boundary set by the United Nations \nSystem of National Accounts (SNA), child labour is defined for measurement purposes to include all persons \naged 5 to 17 years who are engaged in one or more of the following activities during a specified time period:  \n\n•  hazardous work (18th ICLS, paragraphs 21 to 32);  \n•  worst forms of child labour other than hazardous work (18th ICLS, paragraphs 33 to 34); and  \n•  employment below the minimum working age, excluding, where applicable, “light work”, performed by \n\nchildren aged not less than 12 or 13 years  (18th ICLS, paragraphs 35 to 37).  \n \n\nIf, depending upon national policies and circumstances, the general production boundary rather than the SNA \nproduction boundary is used for measuring productive activities by children, child labour will include, in addition \nto these three categories, hazardous unpaid household services. For the sake of clarity, child labour estimated \non this basis should be called “child labour (general production boundary basis)”. \nThe measurement methodology used by the ILO in its global estimates on child labour,1 building on the ICLS \nstatistical definition, classifies child labour on the basis of the following criteria:  \n\n•  Ages 5 to 11: at least 1 hour of economic activity per week;  \n•  Ages 12 to 14: at least 14 hour of economic activity per week in all forms of economic activity except \n\npermissible “light” work, where light work is operationally defined as economic activity that (i) does not \nexceed 14 hours per week and that (ii) is not hazardous in nature; and \n\n•  Ages 15 to 17: work in designated hazardous industries, or in designated hazardous occupations, or for \n\nlong hours. Long hours are defined as 43 or more hours during the reference week. \n\n \nComments and limitations:  \nChild labour estimates based on the statistical standards set out in the ICLS resolution represent useful \nbenchmarks for international comparative purposes but are not necessarily consistent with estimates based on \nnational child labour legislation. ILO Convention No. 138 contains a number of flexibility clauses left to the \ndiscretion of the competent national authority in consultation (where relevant) with workers’ and employers’ \norganizations (e.g., minimum ages, scope of application).2 This means that there is no single legal definition of \nchild labour across countries, and thus, no single statistical measure of child labour consistent with national \nlegislation across countries. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                           \n1 ILO-IPEC. Marking progress against child labour - Global estimates and trends 2000-2012 / International Labour Office, International \nProgramme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) - Geneva: ILO, 2013. \n2  Principal  areas  of  flexibility  in  the  Convention  include:  (a)minimum  ages:  Members  whose  economy  and  educational  facilities  are \ninsufficiently developed may specify a lower general minimum age of 14 years (Art. 2.4) and a lower age range for light work of 12 to 14 \nyears  (Art  7.4);  and  (b)  scope  of  application:  Members  may  exclude  from  the  application  of  the  Convention  limited  (non-hazardous) \ncategories of employment or work in respect of which special and substantial problems of application arise (Art. 4.1). Members whose \neconomy and administrative facilities are insufficiently developed may also initially limit the scope of application of the Convention (Art. \n5.1) beyond a core group of economic activities or undertakings (Art. 5.3). \n\n\f \n \nMethodology  \n\nLast updated: 21 July 2017 \n\nComputation Method:  \n \nChildren aged 5-17: Number of children aged 5-17 reported in child labour during the week prior to the survey \ndivided by the total number of children aged 5-17 in the population, multiplied by 100.  \n \nChildren aged 5-14: Number of children aged 5-14 reported in child labour during the week prior to the survey \ndivided by the total number of children aged 5-14 in the population, multiplied by 100.  \n \nChildren aged 15-17: Number of children aged 15-17 reported child labour during the week prior to the survey \ndivided by the total number of children aged 15-17 in the population, multiplied by 100.  \n \nDisaggregation:  \n \nSex and age.  \n \nData Sources  \n\n \nDescription:  \n \nHousehold surveys such as National Labour Force Surveys, National Multipurpose Household Surveys, UNICEF-\nsupported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), ILO-supported \nStatistical Information and Monitoring Programme on Child Labour (SIMPOC), and World bank Living Standard \nMeasurement surveys (LSMS) are among the most important instruments for generating information on child \nlabour in developing countries. Estimates of child labour incidence generated by these survey instruments are \nincreasingly relied on by countries to monitor progress towards national and global child labour elimination \ntargets. Many countries also produce national labour estimates and reports that often include data on child \nlabour and/or employment among children.  \n \nData Availability  \n\n \nNationally representative and comparable data are currently available for 102 low-and middle-income countries. \n  \nCalendar \n\n \n NA  \n \nData providers  \n\n \nNational Statistical Offices (for the most part) and line ministries/other government agencies and International \nagencies that have conducted labour force surveys or other household surveys through which data on child \nlabour were collected.  \n\n\fLast updated: 21 July 2017 \n\n \n \n \nData compilers  \n\n \nUNICEF and ILO  \n \nReferences  \n\n \nURL:  \ndata.unicef.org   \n\nhttp://www.ilo.org/ipec/ChildlabourstatisticsSIMPOC/Questionnairessurveysandreports/lang--\nen/index.htm  \n\nwww.ucw-project.org  \n\nReferences:  \nhttp://data.unicef.org/child-protection/child-labour.html  \n\nhttp://www.ilo.org/ipec/ChildlabourstatisticsSIMPOC/lang--en/index.htm  \n\nwww.ucw-project.org  \n\n \n\n\f"
