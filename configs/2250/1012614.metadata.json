It aims to measure international differences in cancer survival and, crucially, to identify factors that might be driving these differences.\n\nThe ICBP SURVMARK-2 project was launched in July 2016 and is due to be completed in early 2020.\n\nThe data presented are derived from 21 population-based cancer registries in seven countries (Australia, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, and the United Kingdom) and cover the period 1995–2014, with follow-up until 31 December 2015.",
