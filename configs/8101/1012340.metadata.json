  "descriptionFromProducer": "_[From OECD's indicator explainer](https://www.oecd.org/en/data/indicators/net-oda.html)_\n\nOfficial development assistance (ODA) is defined as government aid designed to promote the economic development and welfare of developing countries. Loans and credits for military purposes are excluded. Aid may be provided bilaterally, from donor to recipient, or channelled through a multilateral development agency such as the United Nations or the World Bank. Aid includes grants, \"soft\" loans and the provision of technical assistance. The OECD maintains a list of developing countries and territories; only aid to these countries counts as ODA. The list is periodically updated and currently contains over 150 countries or territories (see DAC List of ODA Recipients: https://oe.cd/dac-list). A long-standing United Nations target is that developed countries should devote 0.7% of their gross national income to ODA. Prior to 2018, the ODA flows basis methodology covered loans expressed on a “cash basis”, meaning their full face value was included, then repayments were subtracted as they came in. From 2018, the ODA grant-equivalent methodology is used whereby only the “grant portion” of the loan, i.e. the amount “given” by lending below market rates, counts as ODA.",

    "Official development assistance (ODA) is aid given to countries and territories on the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) list of recipients and multilateral development institutions. To qualify as ODA, the aid has to serve the economic development and welfare of recipient countries and be either a grant or a loan with favorable terms.",
    "DAC country recipients are all low- and middle-income countries as defined by the World Bank, or least-developed countries as defined by the United Nations. All recipients are listed on [the OECD website](https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/sub-issues/oda-eligibility-and-conditions/dac-list-of-oda-recipients.html).",
    "Most ODA is provided by [DAC members](https://www.oecd.org/en/about/committees/development-assistance-committee.html), which are major aid donors in the OECD plus the European Union. However, some non-DAC countries, such as Turkey or Saudi Arabia, also give aid that follows ODA guidelines.",
    "ODA does not include military aid, except for the cost of using armed forces to deliver humanitarian aid. It also excludes spending on peacekeeping unless it is closely related to development.",
    "Bilateral ODA also includes cases where a donor contracts a multilateral agency to deliver a program or project on its behalf. This is often referred to as “Bi/Multi” flows. Donor funds channeled through NGOs are also typically counted as bilateral flows.",
    "The data is reported as net disbursements. This refers to aid ultimately given and is different from commitments, which is only aid that has been pledged. These are net amounts because any money coming in (like loan repayments or interest) has been subtracted from money going out (like new grants or loans).",
    "The data is measured in constant 2022 US$ – this adjusts for inflation."
