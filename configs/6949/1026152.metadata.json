    "Industrial robots are machines used in factories to automate tasks like welding, assembly, and packaging.",
    "They are defined as automatically controlled, reprogrammable, and multipurpose machines that can move in three or more directions.",
    "Reprogrammable means their functions can be changed through software without altering their physical parts.",
    "Multipurpose means they can be adapted for different tasks with mechanical changes.",
    "Robots are becoming easier to install and more flexible, which means even small production runs can be automated.",
    "Companies use robots to improve product quality, increase speed, reduce waste, and cut costs."
