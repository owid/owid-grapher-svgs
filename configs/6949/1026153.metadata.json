    "The operational stock of robots refers to the number of robots currently in use.",
    "In Japan, this is measured directly by the Japan Robot Association (JARA).",
    "In other countries, the International Federation of Robotics (IFR) estimates the stock by summing robot installations over the past 12 years. This assumes robots are withdrawn after 12 years of service.",
    "This 12-year assumption may be conservative — a pilot study suggested the average service life could be closer to 15 years.",
    "Tax guidelines in Germany and the US assume shorter lifespans of 5 to 6 years, though these may underestimate actual use due to refurbishment.",
    "The actual service life likely depends on the industry, application, and type of robot. More research is needed to improve these estimates."
