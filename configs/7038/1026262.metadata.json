    "Here, we’ve chosen not to include the most recent years of data in the dataset, as they are likely incomplete, as noted in the original dataset provided by CSET.",
    "The dataset includes over 360,000 AI — related patent families—groups of documents related to a single invention—and counts each family as one patent, treating it as a \"granted patent\" if any document in the family has been granted, or as a \"patent application\" if all documents are still pending.",
    "Inventors often apply for the same patent in multiple countries, so the dataset groups all filings for one invention across jurisdictions into a single patent family, using the year and country of the first application to assign a filing date and location.",
    "For example, if someone files a robot patent first in the European Patent Office and then in China, all documents are grouped under one EPO patent.",
    "The dataset reports where patents are filed, not where inventors are from—for instance, many patents filed in the U.S. are by non — U.S. inventors—so filing location is used as a proxy for innovation and market interest."

      "description": "The research data in CAT (Country Attributes and Topics) is derived from ETO's Merged Academic Corpus (MAC), which contains detailed information on over 270 million scholarly articles worldwide. CAT uses only AI-related articles from the MAC. Articles are attributed to countries based on the author organizations listed in each article's metadata. An article is attributed to a country if it lists at least one author affiliated with an organization in that country.\n\nThe top ten authors for each country are identified based on the number of citations to articles they released while affiliated with institutions in that country. CAT classifies articles into AI subfields using subject assignment scores in the MAC. Articles are assigned to up to three subfields based on their scores.\n\nCAT includes patent data from 1790 Analytics and Dimensions, and it counts AI-related patent families, including patent applications and granted patents. Patents are attributed to the country where they are filed, not necessarily the inventor's nationality. CAT also uses Crunchbase data to identify AI-related companies based on various criteria and includes investment metrics for these companies.\n\nThe data in CAT is updated at least once a quarter, with plans for more frequent updates in the future.",
