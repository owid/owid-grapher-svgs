Such populations are those for which plastic waste is at risk of leading to ocean debris. Sources further inland are significantly less likely to end up as ocean debris.\n\nThe authors define mismanaged and inadequately managed waste as follows: \"mismanaged waste is material that is either littered or inadequately disposed. Inadequately disposed waste is not formally managed and includes disposal in dumps or open, uncontrolled landfills, where it is not fully contained. Mismanaged waste could eventually enter the ocean via inland waterways, wastewater outflows, and transport by wind or tides.\"\n\nNational data has been aggregated by region by Our World in Data. We have aggregated national totals based on World Bank regional definitions."}}},"entityKey":{"289":{"name":"Sub-Saharan Africa","code":null},"294":{"name":"North America","code":null},"300":{"name":"Europe and Central Asia","code":null},"301":{"name":"Middle East and North Africa","code":null},"302":{"name":"South Asia","code":null},"342":{"name":"East Asia and Pacific","code":null},"34620":{"name":"Latin America and Caribbean","code":null}}}
