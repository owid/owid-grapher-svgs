The report is based primarily on Homeless Management Information Systems (HMIS) data about persons who experience homelessness during a 12-month period\".\r\n\r\nAll HUD reports are available at https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/hdx/guides/ahar/#reports.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAdditional info on Population data:\r\n\r\nAs explained by their Guidance for Data: \"the Census Bureauâ€™s Population Estimates Program (PEP) releases several different data series over the course of each decade\". \r\n\r\nTotal U.S. population figures for the period 2007-2010 are taken from the 'Intercensal Estimates 2000-2010'. Each decade, PEP releases these 'Intercensal Estimates' which constitutes the preferred data series for the decade.  \r\n\r\nTotal U.S. population figures for the period 2011-2016 are taken from the 'National Population Totals Tables: 2010-2016'. These estimates \"are produced using a similar procedure to that used for our current postcensal estimates series, and with no knowledge of the Census count at the end of the decade.\""
