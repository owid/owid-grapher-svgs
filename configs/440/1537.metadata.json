A full table of definitions used for the purpose of data collection in the OECD can be found in Annex 1 of OECD Affordable Housing Database (2016) (https://www.oecd.org/els/family/HC3-1-Homeless-population.pdf)\n\nThe variable Homelessness – OECD corresponds to homelessness estimates including exclusively (i) people living in the streets or public spaces without a shelter that can be defined as living quarters; (ii) people in emergency accommodation with no place of usual residence, who move frequently between various types of accommodation; and (iii) people living in accommodation for the homeless, including homeless hostels, temporary accommodation and other types of shelters for the homeless.\n\nThe variable Precarious housing – OECD corresponds to homelessness estimates including the three categories mentioned above, plus (iv) people living in institutions and (v) people living temporarily in conventional housing with family and friends."
