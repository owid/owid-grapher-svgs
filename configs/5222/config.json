This is the fraction of the fish population that is caught in a given year.\n\nHere it's measured as the intensity divided by the intensity at the [maximum sustainable yield](hover::biodiversity::msy) – the level at which we can catch the maximum amount of fish without a decline in fish populations. A value of one is the optimal level to maximize fish catch without declining populations. Greater than one suggests overfishing.",
