and among countries \nTarget 10.4: Adopt policies, especially fiscal, wage and social protection policies, and progressively \nachieve greater equality \nIndicator 10.4.1: Labour share of GDP, comprising wages and social protection transfers \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \n \nInternational Labour Organization (ILO)s \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n \nDefinition: \n \nLabour share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the total compensation of employees given as a percent \nof GDP, which is a measure of total output. It provides information about the relative share of output \nwhich is paid as compensation to employees as compared with the share paid to capital in the production \nprocess for a given reference period. \n \nRationale: \n \nLabour share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) seeks to inform about the relative share of GDP which \naccrues to workers as compared to the share which accrues to capital in a given reference period.  \n \nIn order to interpret this indicator effectively, it is important to consider it together with economic \ngrowth trends. The share of labour compensation in national output can highlight the extent to which \neconomic growth translates into higher incomes for employees over time (and/or higher earnings for the \nself-employed). In periods of economic recession, the labour income share provides an indication of the \nextent to which falling output reduces labour income relative to profits. If labour income falls at a greater \nrate than profits, the labour income share will be expected to fall. By contrast, if there is a sharper decline \nin profits than in labour income, the share will rise. For any given level of GDP and profits, the labour \nincome share can fall as a result of falling wages, falling earnings of the self-employed, changes in the \ncomposition of employment by income or a combination these. \n \nIncreased production and GDP often lead to improved living standards of individuals in the economy, but \nthis will depend on the distribution of real income and public policy among other factors.  \nIf there is a large number of non-resident border or seasonal workers or inflows and outflows of property \nincome such that the value of production differs from the income of residents, there may be a situation \nof over or understating the living standards of residents. \n \nConcepts: \n \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: March 2019 \n\nCompensation of employees is the total in-cash or in-kind remuneration payable to the employee by the \nenterprise for the work performed by the employee during the accounting period. Compensation of \nemployees includes: (i) wages and salaries (in cash or in kind) and (ii) social insurance contributions \npayable by employers. This concept views compensation of employees as a cost to employer, thus \ncompensation equals zero for unpaid work undertaken voluntarily. Moreover, it does not include taxes \npayable by employers on the wage and salary bill, such as payroll tax. \n \nThe indicator should be produced using data that cover all economic activities, all employees, and ideally \nall self-employed. \n \nGross domestic product (GDP) represents the market value of all final goods and services produced \nduring a specific time period (for the purposes of this indicator, one year) in a country's territory. \n \nPersons in employment are defined as all those who, during a short reference period, such as one week \nor one day, performed work for others in exchange for pay or profit.  \n \nPersons in employment include employees and self-employed. \n \nEmployees are all those workers who hold the type of job defined as paid employment jobs, that is, jobs \nwhere the incumbents hold explicit or implicit employment contracts giving them a basic remuneration \nnot directly dependent on the revenue of the unit for which they work.  \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nIn general, labour share in GDP calculated based only on the compensation of employees will \nunderestimate the proportion of GDP accrued to total employment, as it does not include the labour \nincome of the self-employed. Thus the indicator calculated in such a way may be less relevant in \ncountries where a large proportion of employment is in self-employment. An adjusted labour share \nshould be estimated to take into account the labour income of self-employed workers. \n \nGDP may exclude or underreport activities that are difficult to measure, such as transactions in the \ninformal sector or in illegal markets, etc. thus understating the GDP. Moreover, GDP does not account for \nthe social and environmental costs of production, and is therefore is not a good measure of the level of \nover-all wellbeing. \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \n \nLabour share of Gross Domestic Product = Total compensation of employees / Gross Domestic Product * \n100 \n \nAs mentioned above, this calculation method does not provide a comprehensive measure of the labour \nincome share, as it does not take into account the labour income of the self-employed.  \nIdeally, wherever possible, the numerator should be adjusted to include not only compensation of \nemployees, but earnings of the self-employed as well. \n\n\fLast updated: March 2019 \n\n \n\n \nDisaggregation: \n \nNo disaggregations are required for this indicator. \n \nData Sources \n\n \nThe recommended primary data sources for this indicator are the national accounts estimates of GDP and \ncompensation of employees. The periodicity of this indicator will hence depend on the national accounts \ndata produced in the given country. \n \nThe source of the data should be presented when providing estimates of the indicator, as well as the \nSystem of National Accounts revision (preferably the SNA 2008). The concept definition of compensation \nof employees that is used should be specified, or alternatively, if another wage or labour income concept \nis used, this should be clearly indicated. \n \nData Availability \n\n \nNA \n \nCalendar \n\n \nNA \n \nData providers \n\n \nNational Statistical Offices \n \nData compilers \n\n \nILO \n \nReferences \n\n \nURL: \n \nwww.ilo.org/ilostat \n \nReferences: \n \n\n\fLast updated: March 2019 \n\n- \n\n- \n- \n\nILO Guidebook - Decent Work and the Sustainable Development Goals: A Guidebook on SDG \nLabour Market Indicators (https://www.ilo.org/stat/Publications/WCMS_647109/lang--\nen/index.htm ) \nILOSTAT: www.ilo.org/ilostat \nILO Social Protection Data and Indicators: http://www.social-\nprotection.org/gimi/gess/ShowTheme.action?th.themeId=10&lang=EN  \nSystem of National Accounts: http://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/sna.asp  \n\n- \n-  Decent Work Indicators Manual: http://www.ilo.org/stat/Publications/WCMS_223121/lang--\n\nen/index.htm  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f"}}},"entityKey":{"1":{"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GBR"},"2":{"name":"Ireland","code":"IRL"},"3":{"name":"France","code":"FRA"},"4":{"name":"Belgium","code":"BEL"},"5":{"name":"Netherlands","code":"NLD"},"6":{"name":"Germany","code":"DEU"},"7":{"name":"Switzerland","code":"CHE"},"8":{"name":"Italy","code":"ITA"},"9":{"name":"Spain","code":"ESP"},"10":{"name":"Sweden","code":"SWE"},"11":{"name":"Poland","code":"POL"},"12":{"name":"Russia","code":"RUS"},"13":{"name":"United States","code":"USA"},"14":{"name":"Japan","code":"JPN"},"21":{"name":"Argentina","code":"ARG"},"22":{"name":"Armenia","code":"ARM"},"23":{"name":"Australia","code":"AUS"},"24":{"name":"Austria","code":"AUT"},"25":{"name":"Azerbaijan","code":"AZE"},"30":{"name":"Belarus","code":"BLR"},"39":{"name":"Bulgaria","code":"BGR"},"44":{"name":"Canada","code":"CAN"},"66":{"name":"North Macedonia","code":"MKD"},"67":{"name":"Ukraine","code":"UKR"},"70":{"name":"Turkey","code":"TUR"},"72":{"name":"United Arab Emirates","code":"ARE"},"80":{"name":"Zimbabwe","code":"ZWE"},"81":{"name":"South Africa","code":"ZAF"},"83":{"name":"Slovenia","code":"SVN"},"85":{"name":"Slovakia","code":"SVK"},"86":{"name":"Singapore","code":"SGP"},"88":{"name":"Serbia","code":"SRB"},"90":{"name":"Saudi Arabia","code":"SAU"},"92":{"name":"Romania","code":"ROU"},"95":{"name":"Portugal","code":"PRT"},"96":{"name":"Philippines","code":"PHL"},"97":{"name":"Peru","code":"PER"},"102":{"name":"Norway","code":"NOR"},"104":{"name":"Niger","code":"NER"},"106":{"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZL"},"111":{"name":"Moldova","code":"MDA"},"112":{"name":"Mongolia","code":"MNG"},"113":{"name":"Mexico","code":"MEX"},"116":{"name":"Malaysia","code":"MYS"},"119":{"name":"Lithuania","code":"LTU"},"122":{"name":"Latvia","code":"LVA"},"126":{"name":"Kyrgyzstan","code":"KGZ"},"127":{"name":"South Korea","code":"KOR"},"133":{"name":"Israel","code":"ISR"},"134":{"name":"Iraq","code":"IRQ"},"137":{"name":"India","code":"IND"},"138":{"name":"Hungary","code":"HUN"},"141":{"name":"Sri Lanka","code":"LKA"},"144":{"name":"Hong Kong","code":"HKG"},"147":{"name":"Guinea","code":"GIN"},"149":{"name":"Greece","code":"GRC"},"152":{"name":"Georgia","code":"GEO"},"155":{"name":"Finland","code":"FIN"},"156":{"name":"Estonia","code":"EST"},"161":{"name":"Denmark","code":"DNK"},"162":{"name":"Czechia","code":"CZE"},"163":{"name":"Cyprus","code":"CYP"},"164":{"name":"Cuba","code":"CUB"},"165":{"name":"Croatia","code":"HRV"},"166":{"name":"Costa Rica","code":"CRI"},"170":{"name":"Colombia","code":"COL"},"172":{"name":"Chile","code":"CHL"},"194":{"name":"Bermuda","code":"BMU"},"205":{"name":"Greenland","code":"GRL"},"207":{"name":"Iceland","code":"ISL"},"208":{"name":"Kuwait","code":"KWT"},"210":{"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LUX"},"212":{"name":"Malta","code":"MLT"},"219":{"name":"Aruba","code":"ABW"},"226":{"name":"Qatar","code":"QAT"},"231":{"name":"San Marino","code":"SMR"},"238":{"name":"Venezuela","code":"VEN"},"245":{"name":"Reunion","code":"REU"},"262":{"name":"Macao","code":"MAC"},"265":{"name":"Isle of Man","code":"IMN"}}}
