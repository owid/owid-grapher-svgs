      "description": "Data on elephant populations was gathered on two species: the African elephant, and the Asian elephant.\n\nAfrican elephant population data was primarily gathered from the African Elephant Database. Available at: https://africanelephantdatabase.org/report/2016/Africa\n\nPrior to 2013, this data was collected and reported on the basis of the DPPS method, where estimates were given as 'Definite', 'Probable', 'Possible' and 'Speculative'. Here we have taken \"Definitive\" survey counts for all years. However, we also compared data based on \"Definitive\" + \"Probable\" estimates, and the overall trends are similar. However, these counts always come with uncertainty.\nLonger historical estimates for 1979 come from the work of Douglas-Hamilton (1979). These estimates come with significant uncertainty, and may be overestimates. \n\nFigures for some countries on 'carcass ratio' are also provided. The carcass ratio is the number of  dead elephants observed during \nthe count, as a percentage of the total population. Carcass ratios of more than 8 percent are considered to indicate poaching at a high enough level to cause a declining population.\n\nAsian elephant population data is sourced primarily from the Asian Elephant Specialist Group (AsESG); UN FAO and national records. Latest estimates are available here: https://iucn.org/our-union/commissions/group/iucn-ssc-asian-elephant-specialist-group\n\nThese have been supplemented with longer records for Nepal (http://www.fao.org/3/ad031e/ad031e0e.htm); China (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0124834); Vietnam (http://www.fao.org/3/ad031e/ad031e0f.htm); and India (https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/23637/7/07_chapter%201.pdf).",
