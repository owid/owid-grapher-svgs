  "descriptionShort": "Marine coatings are specialized protective coatings applied to ships, boats, and other marine structures to protect them from corrosion, fouling, and the harsh marine environment. These coatings are designed to be durable, resistant to saltwater, ultraviolet light, and harsh weather conditions, and are critical for extending the life of marine vessels and structures, improving their performance, and reducing maintenance costs.",

      "descriptionSnapshot": "This dataset gives global estimates of plastic use, broken down by polymer type. The use of primary plastics is estimated from regional consumption data, assuming a consistent split by polymer type across different applications globally, as per Ryberg et al. (2019). Historical values (data from before 2015) are extrapolated using the evolution model in Geyer, Jambeck and Law (2017). The use of secondary plastics is calculated using recycling and recycling loss rates, as detailed in the GPO annex. These plastic use data are then related to economic flows in the OECD ENV-Linkages model to track changes over time. The total plastic use is the combined amount of primary and secondary plastic use.",
