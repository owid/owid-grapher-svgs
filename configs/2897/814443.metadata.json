  "descriptionShort": "Polystyrene (PS) is a versatile plastic known for its rigidity, clarity, and heat resistance, and it is commonly used in food packaging, like disposable cups and trays, insulation, and consumer goods. While it is technically recyclable, the actual recycling rate is quite low due to economic and environmental issues associated with its recycling process.",

      "descriptionSnapshot": "This dataset gives global estimates of plastic use, broken down by polymer type. The use of primary plastics is estimated from regional consumption data, assuming a consistent split by polymer type across different applications globally, as per Ryberg et al. (2019). Historical values (data from before 2015) are extrapolated using the evolution model in Geyer, Jambeck and Law (2017). The use of secondary plastics is calculated using recycling and recycling loss rates, as detailed in the GPO annex. These plastic use data are then related to economic flows in the OECD ENV-Linkages model to track changes over time. The total plastic use is the combined amount of primary and secondary plastic use.",
