Available at: http://www.bp.com/statisticalreview\n\nPrimary energy in exajoules (EJ) has been converted to TWh by Our World in Data based on a conversion factor of 277.778.\n\nEach source's share of energy based on the \"substitution method\" were calculated by Our World in Data by taking all energy sources' energy normalised to EJ – this takes account of the inefficiencies in fossil fuel production and is a better approximation of \"final energy\" consumption.\n\nAdditional metrics have been calculated by Our World in Data:\n– Annual change in energy consumption by source: this is calculated as the difference from the previous year\n– % of total primary energy: calculated as each source's share of primary energy from all sources\n– Per capita energy by source: calculated as primary energy consumption by source, divided by population (source from the UN Population Division)"}}},"entityKey":{"1":{"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GBR"},"2":{"name":"Ireland","code":"IRL"},"3":{"name":"France","code":"FRA"},"4":{"name":"Belgium","code":"BEL"},"5":{"name":"Netherlands","code":"NLD"},"6":{"name":"Germany","code":"DEU"},"7":{"name":"Switzerland","code":"CHE"},"8":{"name":"Italy","code":"ITA"},"9":{"name":"Spain","code":"ESP"},"10":{"name":"Sweden","code":"SWE"},"11":{"name":"Poland","code":"POL"},"12":{"name":"Russia","code":"RUS"},"13":{"name":"United States","code":"USA"},"14":{"name":"Japan","code":"JPN"},"17":{"name":"Algeria","code":"DZA"},"21":{"name":"Argentina","code":"ARG"},"23":{"name":"Australia","code":"AUS"},"24":{"name":"Austria","code":"AUT"},"25":{"name":"Azerbaijan","code":"AZE"},"28":{"name":"Bangladesh","code":"BGD"},"30":{"name":"Belarus","code":"BLR"},"37":{"name":"Brazil","code":"BRA"},"39":{"name":"Bulgaria","code":"BGR"},"44":{"name":"Canada","code":"CAN"},"65":{"name":"Egypt","code":"EGY"},"66":{"name":"North Macedonia","code":"MKD"},"67":{"name":"Ukraine","code":"UKR"},"70":{"name":"Turkey","code":"TUR"},"72":{"name":"United Arab Emirates","code":"ARE"},"75":{"name":"Thailand","code":"THA"},"81":{"name":"South Africa","code":"ZAF"},"83":{"name":"Slovenia","code":"SVN"},"84":{"name":"Vietnam","code":"VNM"},"85":{"name":"Slovakia","code":"SVK"},"92":{"name":"Romania","code":"ROU"},"95":{"name":"Portugal","code":"PRT"},"96":{"name":"Philippines","code":"PHL"},"97":{"name":"Peru","code":"PER"},"101":{"name":"Pakistan","code":"PAK"},"102":{"name":"Norway","code":"NOR"},"106":{"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZL"},"110":{"name":"Morocco","code":"MAR"},"113":{"name":"Mexico","code":"MEX"},"119":{"name":"Lithuania","code":"LTU"},"122":{"name":"Latvia","code":"LVA"},"127":{"name":"South Korea","code":"KOR"},"131":{"name":"Kazakhstan","code":"KAZ"},"133":{"name":"Israel","code":"ISR"},"135":{"name":"Iran","code":"IRN"},"136":{"name":"Indonesia","code":"IDN"},"137":{"name":"India","code":"IND"},"138":{"name":"Hungary","code":"HUN"},"141":{"name":"Sri Lanka","code":"LKA"},"144":{"name":"Hong Kong","code":"HKG"},"149":{"name":"Greece","code":"GRC"},"155":{"name":"Finland","code":"FIN"},"156":{"name":"Estonia","code":"EST"},"161":{"name":"Denmark","code":"DNK"},"162":{"name":"Czechia","code":"CZE"},"163":{"name":"Cyprus","code":"CYP"},"165":{"name":"Croatia","code":"HRV"},"170":{"name":"Colombia","code":"COL"},"171":{"name":"China","code":"CHN"},"172":{"name":"Chile","code":"CHL"},"198":{"name":"Taiwan","code":"TWN"},"201":{"name":"Ecuador","code":"ECU"},"207":{"name":"Iceland","code":"ISL"},"208":{"name":"Kuwait","code":"KWT"},"210":{"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LUX"},"238":{"name":"Venezuela","code":"VEN"},"273":{"name":"Africa","code":null},"276":{"name":"Europe","code":null},"294":{"name":"North America","code":null},"355":{"name":"World","code":"OWID_WRL"}}}
