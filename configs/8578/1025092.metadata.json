    "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common viral infection that can cause genital warts and is linked to several cancers, including cervical, anal, and throat cancers. The HPV vaccine provides effective protection against the most high-risk types of the virus and helps prevent related cancers.",
    "Vaccines included in a countryâ€™s vaccination program are those that are provided and recommended through routine services.",
    "They may or may not be mandatory and their coverage rates may vary widely.",
    "When countries do not have a vaccine in their schedule, this does not necessarily mean that the vaccine is completely unavailable in those countries, as it may be available commercially."
