Fishing intensity by the fraction of the fish population that is caught in a given year.\n\nBoth are given as a ratio of their levels at the maximum sustainable yield – the level at which we can catch the maximum amount of fish without a decline in fish populations. A value of one maximises fish catch without decreasing fish populations. This is the target level.",
