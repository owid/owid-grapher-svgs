    "additionalInfo": "EM-DAT data includes all categories classified as \"natural disasters\" (distinguished from technological disasters, such as oil spills and industrial accidents). This includes those from drought, earthquakes, extreme temperatures, extreme weather, floods, fogs, glacial lake outbursts, landslide, dry mass movements, volcanic activity, and wildfires.\n\nDisaster-related deaths from EM-DAT have been normalized by Our World in Data to global population size based on <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/population-sources\">different sources</a>. This provides data in terms of cases per 100,000 people.\n\nOur World in Data has also calculated economic damage metrics adjusted for gross domestic product (GDP), using GDP data from <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators\">the World Bank's World Development Indicators</a>.\n\nLatest update: 2022-12-06.\nThis dataset is updated regularly. On Our World in Data, given that we only show yearly (or decadal) data, we will update this dataset on a yearly basis. At the link above you can directly access the source page and see the latest available data.\n\nEM-DAT defines the following variables as:\n\n+ Affected: People requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency, i.e. requiring basic survival needs such as food, water, shelter, sanitation and immediate medical assistance.\n\n+ Injured: People suffering from physical injuries, trauma or an illness requiring immediate medical assistance as a direct result of a disaster.\n\n+ Homeless: Number of people whose house is destroyed or heavily damaged and therefore need shelter after an event.\n\n+ Total affected: In EM-DAT, it is the sum of the injured, affected and left homeless after a disaster.\n\n+ Estimated economic damage: The amount of damage to property, crops, and livestock. In EM-DAT estimated damage are given in US$ ('000). For each disaster, the registered figure corresponds to the damage value at the moment of the event, i.e. the figures are shown true to the year of the event.\n\n+ Total deaths: In EM-DAT, it is the sum of deaths and missing.\n\nEM-DAT defines the following types of disasters as:\n\n+ Drought: An extended period of unusually low precipitation that produces a shortage of water for people, animals and plants. Drought is different from most other hazards in that it develops slowly, sometimes even over years, and its onset is generally difficult to detect. Drought is not solely a physical phenomenon because its impacts can be exacerbated by human activities and water supply demands. Drought is therefore often defined both conceptually and operationally. Operational definitions of drought, meaning the degree of precipitation reduction that constitutes a drought, vary by locality, climate and environmental sector.\n\n+ Earthquake: Sudden movement of a block of the Earth's crust along a geological fault and associated ground shaking.\n\n+ Extreme temperature: Extreme temperature.\n\n+ Flood: A general term for the overflow of water from a stream channel onto normally dry land in the floodplain (riverine flooding), higher-than-normal levels along the coast and in lakes or reservoirs (coastal flooding) as well as ponding of water at or near the point where the rain fell (flash floods).\n\n+ Fog: Water droplets that are suspended in the air near the Earth's surface. Fog is simply a cloud that is in contact with the ground.\n\n+ Glacial lake outburst: A flood that occurs when water dammed by a glacier or moraine is suddenly released. Glacial lakes can be at the front of the glacier (marginal lake) or below the ice sheet (sub-glacial lake).\n\n+ Landslide: Any kind of moderate to rapid soil movement incl. lahar, mudslide, debris flow. A landslide is the movement of soil or rock controlled by gravity and the speed of the movement usually ranges between slow and rapid, but not very slow. It can be superficial or deep, but the materials have to make up a mass that is a portion of the slope or the slope itself. The movement has to be downward and outward with a free face.\n\n+ Mass movement: Any type of downslope movement of earth materials.\n\n+ Extreme weather: Storm.\n\n+ Volcanic activity: A type of volcanic event near an opening/vent in the Earth's surface including volcanic eruptions of lava, ash, hot vapour, gas, and pyroclastic material.\n\n+ Wildfire: Any uncontrolled and non-prescribed combustion or burning of plants in a natural setting such as a forest, grassland, brush land or tundra, which consumes the natural fuels and spreads based on environmental conditions (e.g., wind, topography). Wildfires can be triggered by lightning or human actions.\n"
