  "description": "Monthly share of the population who have not received a COVID-19 vaccine and who do NOT agree with the statement: \"If a COVID-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, I would definitely get it.\" Respondents were presented with a 1 to 5 scale, ranging from \"Strongly agree\" (1) to \"Strongly disagree\" (5). We consider responses of 4 or 5 to NOT be in agreement with the statement.\n\nThis statement was only presented to survey respondents who said they have not received a COVID-19 vaccination. To aggregate these responses into a share of a country's population, we multiply the share of respondents who do not agree with the statement by the share of the country's population that is unvaccinated. Data on the share of a country's population that is unvaccinated comes from public official sources, collated by Our World in Data at https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations.\n\nIndividuals under 18 years of age were not surveyed. As a result, the share of survey respondents who do not agree with the statement is a representative estimate of the share of a country's unvaccinated population aged 18 and above that would not agree with the statement, but is not necessarily a representative estimate of the share of a country's unvaccinated population of all ages that would not agree with the statement. Nevertheless, we expect any differences to be minor.\n\nMonths containing fewer than 500 survey respondents are excluded.",

YouGov has partnered with the Institute of Global Health Innovation (IGHI) at Imperial College London to gather global insights on people’s behaviors in response to COVID-19. The research will cover 29 countries, interviewing around 21,000 people each week.\n\nIt is designed to provide behavioral analysis on how different populations are responding to the pandemic, helping public health bodies in their efforts to limit the impact of the disease. Anonymized respondent level data will be available for all public health and academic institutions globally.\n\nThe questions in the survey, led by IGHI, cover data on testing, symptoms, self-isolating in response to symptoms and the ability and willingness to self-isolate if needed. It also looks at behaviors, including going outdoors, working outside the home, contact with others, handwashing and the extent of compliance with 20 common preventative measures.\n\n(2) COVID-19 vaccination figures collated by Our World in Data from public official sources.
