and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all \nTarget 6.2: By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end \nopen defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable \nsituations \nIndicator 6.2.1: Proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services, including a hand-\nwashing facility with soap and water \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \n \nWorld Health Organization (WHO) \n \nUnited Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n \nDefinition: \n \nThe Proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services, including a hand-washing facility \nwith soap and water is currently being measured by the proportion of the population using a basic \nsanitation facility which is not shared with other households and where excreta is safely disposed in situ \nor treated off-site. ‘Improved’ sanitation facilities include: flush or pour flush toilets to sewer systems, \nseptic tanks or pit latrines, ventilated improved pit latrines, pit latrines with a slab, and composting \ntoilets.  \n \nPopulation with a basic handwashing facility: a device to contain, transport or regulate the flow of water \nto facilitate handwashing with soap and water in the household. \n \nRationale: \n \nMDG target 7C called for ‘sustainable access’ to ‘basic sanitation’. The JMP developed the metric of use \nof ‘improved’ sanitation facilities, which are likely to hygienically separate human excreta from human \ncontact, and has used this indicator to track progress towards the MDG target since 2000. International \nconsultations since 2011 have established consensus on the need to build on and address the \nshortcomings of this indicator; specifically, to address normative criteria of the human right to water \nincluding accessibility, acceptability, and safety. Furthermore, the safe management of faecal wastes \nshould be considered, as discharges of untreated wastewater into the environment create public health \nhazards. \n \nThe above consultation concluded that post-2015 targets, which apply to all countries, should go beyond \nthe basic level of access and address indicators of safe management of sanitation services, including \ndimensions of accessibility, acceptability and safety. The Expert Working Group called for analysis of \nfaecal waste management along the sanitation chain, including containment, emptying of latrines and \nseptic tanks, and safe on-site disposal or the transport and treatment of wastes at a designated \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 29 September 2017 \n\ntreatment site. Classification of treatment will be based on categories defined by SEEA and the \nInternational Recommendations for Water Statistics and following a laddered approach (primary, \nsecondary and tertiary treatment). \n \nHandwashing with soap is widely agreed to be the top hygiene priority for improving health outcomes. In \n2008 and 2009, the JMP supported a review of indicators of handwashing practice, and determined that \nthe most practical approach leading to reliable measurement of handwashing in national household \nsurveys was observation of the place where household members wash their hands and noting the \npresence of water and soap (or local alternative) at that location. This provides a measure of whether \nhouseholds have the necessary tools for handwashing and is a proxy for their behaviour. Observation by \nsurvey enumerators represents a more reliable, valid and efficient indicator for measuring handwashing \nbehaviour than asking individuals to report their own behaviour. \n \nConcepts: \n \nImproved sanitation facilities include the following: flush or pour flush toilets to sewer systems, septic \ntanks or pit latrines, ventilated improved pit latrines, pit latrines with a slab, and composting toilets. \n \nSafely disposed in situ; when pit latrines and septic tanks are not emptied, the excreta may still remain \nisolated from human contact and can be considered safely managed. For example, with the new SDG \nindicator, households that use twin pit latrines or safely abandon full pit latrines and dig new facilities, a \ncommon practice in rural areas, would be counted as using safely managed sanitation services. \n \nTreated offsite; not all excreta from toilet facilities conveyed in sewers (as wastewater) or emptied from \npit latrines and septic tanks (as faecal sludge) reaches a treatment site. For instance, a portion may leak \nfrom the sewer itself or, due to broken pumping installations, be discharged directly to the environment. \nSimilarly, a portion of the faecal sludge emptied from containers may be discharged into open drains, to \nopen ground or water bodies, rather than being transported to a treatment plant. And finally, even once \nthe excreta reaches a treatment plant a portion may remain untreated, due to dysfunctional treatment \nequipment or inadequate treatment capacity, and be discharged to the environment. For the purposes of \nSDG monitoring, adequacy of treatment will initially be assessed based on the reported level of \ntreatment. \n \nA handwashing facility with soap and water: a handwashing facility is a device to contain, transport or \nregulate the flow of water to facilitate handwashing. This indicator is a proxy of actual handwashing \npractice, which has been found to be more accurate than other proxies such as self-reports of \nhandwashing practices. \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nA framework for measuring faecal waste flows and safety factors has been developed and piloted in 12 \ncountries (World Bank Water and Sanitation Program, 2014), and is being adopted and scaled up within \nthe sanitation sector. This framework has served as the basis for indicators 6.2.1 and 6.3.1. Data on safe \ndisposal and treatment are not available for all countries. However, sufficient data were available to \nmake global and regional estimates of safely managed sanitation services in 2017. \n \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 29 September 2017 \n\nPresence of a handwashing station with soap and water does not guarantee that household members \nconsistently wash hands at key times, but has been accepted as the most suitable proxy. Data were \navailable for 70 countries in 2017. \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \n \nMethod of computation: Household surveys and censuses provide data on use of types of basic sanitation \nfacilities listed above, as well as the presence of handwashing materials in the home.  \n \nThe percentage of the population using safely managed sanitation services is calculated by combining \ndata on the proportion of the population using different types of basic sanitation facilities with estimates \nof the proportion of faecal waste which is safely disposed in situ or treated off-site.  \n \nThe JMP estimates use of basic sanitation facilities for each country, separately in urban and rural areas, \nby fitting a regression model to a series of data points from household surveys and censuses. This \napproach was used to report on use of ‘improved sanitation’ facilities for MDG monitoring. The JMP is \nevaluating the use of alternative statistical estimation methods as more data become available. \n \nThe JMP 2017 update and SDG baselines report describes in more detail how estimates of the proportion \nof household wastewater that is safely disposed of in situ or treated off-site have been combined with \ndata on use of different types of sanitation facilities, as recorded in the JMP global database.  \n \nDisaggregation: \n \nDisaggregation by place of residence (urban/rural) and socioeconomic status (wealth, affordability) is \npossible for all countries. Disaggregation by other stratifies of inequality (subnational, gender, \ndisadvantaged groups, etc.) will be made where data permit. Sanitation services will be disaggregated by \nservice level (including no services, basic, and safely managed services) following the JMP sanitation \nladder. \n \nTreatment of missing values: \n \n\n•  At country level \n\nThe JMP method uses a simple regression model to generate time series estimates for all years \nincluding for years without data points. The JMP then shares all its estimates using its country \nconsultation mechanism to get consensus from countries before publishing its estimates. \n \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\nThe JMP does not publish estimates for countries for which national data are not available. \nRegional and global estimates are made for basic services as long as data are available for 50% of \nthe population with the region, weighting by the latest UNPD population estimates. Regional and \nglobal estimates for safely managed services used a lower threshold of 30% for the JMP 2017 update \nand SDG baselines report. \n \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 29 September 2017 \n\nRegional aggregates: \n \nFor more details on JMP rules and methods, please consult the website: www.washdata.org. \n \nSources of discrepancies: \n \nJMP estimates are based on national sources of data approved as official statistics. Differences between \nglobal and national figures arise due to differences in indicator definitions and methods used in \ncalculating national coverage estimates. In some cases national estimates are based on the most recent \ndata point rather than from regression on all data points as done by the JMP. In some cases national \nestimates draw on administrative sector data rather than the nationally representative surveys and \ncensuses used by the JMP. \n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \n \nAccess to water and sanitation are considered core socio-economic and health indicators, and key \ndeterminants of child survival, maternal, and children’s health, family wellbeing, and economic \nproductivity. Drinking water and sanitation facilities are also used in constructing wealth quintiles used by \nmany integrated household surveys to analyse inequalities between rich and poor. Access to sanitation is \ntherefore a core indicator for most household surveys. Currently the JMP database holds over 1,700 \nsurveys and censuses. In high-income countries where household surveys or censuses do not always \ncollect information on basic access, data are drawn from administrative records. \n \nEstimates of excreta management will be collected from countries and used to adjust the data on use of \nbasic sanitation facilities as needed. Administrative, population and environmental data can also be \ncombined to estimate safe disposal or transport of excreta, when no country data are available. Data on \ndisposal or treatment of excreta are limited but estimates for safe management of faecal wastes can be \ncalculated based on faecal waste flows associated with the use of different types of basic sanitation \nfacility. \n \nSince the handwashing with soap survey questions were standardized in 2009, over 70 DHS and MICS \nsurveys have included the module. JMP published handwashing estimates for 12 countries in its 2014 \nupdate, for 54 countries in its 2015 update, and for 70 countries in its 2017 update. \n \nThe population data used by JMP, including the proportion of the population living in urban and rural \nareas, are those established by the UN Population Division. \n \nCollection process: \n \nWHO is required by World Health Assembly resolution to consult on all WHO statistics, and seek feedback \nfrom countries on data about countries and territories. Before publishing, all JMP estimates undergo \nrigorous country consultations facilitated by WHO and UNICEF country offices. Often these consultations \ngive rise to in-country visits, and meetings about data on drinking water, sanitation and hygiene services \n\n\fLast updated: 29 September 2017 \n\nand the monitoring systems that collect these data. The JMP has been engaged with more than fifty \ncountries over the last 10 years in explaining JMP estimates, and reasons for discrepancies if any.  \n \nData Availability \n\n \n\n \nDescription: \n \n\nIn the JMP 2017 report estimates for basic sanitation services were available for nearly all countries \nand estimates for safely managed sanitation services were made for 96 countries at national level. \nSufficient data were available to estimate safely managed drinking water services at the regional level \nfor the following five SDG regions: Australia and New Zealand, Eastern Asia and South-eastern Asia, \nLatin America and the Caribbean, Northern America and Europe, Western Asia and Northern Africa \n \nData on basic handwashing facilities were available for 70 countries and regional estimates were \npossible for Sub-Saharan Africa and Western Asia and Northern Africa.  \n \nTime series: \n \nTime series data are available for the basic sanitation level of service over the period 2000-2015. These \nserve as the foundation for the safely managed sanitation service indicator. Some elements of safe \nmanagement (e.g. wastewater treatment) were not collected during the MDG period and trend analysis \nwill only be possible several years into the SDGs. (From 2000 to 2015) \n \nCalendar \n\n \nData collection: \n \nThe current biennial data collection cycle begins in October during an even year and estimates are \npublished during the following year.  \n \nData release: \n \nThe baseline SDG report was published in July 2017 and feed into the SG’s 2017 SDG Progress Report. . \nThe estimates will be updated in 2019. \n \nData providers \n\n \nNational statistics offices, Ministries of water, sanitation, health, environment.
