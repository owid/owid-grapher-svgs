    "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures inflation — how the average prices of goods and services change over time.",
    "This CPI item falls under “Tuition, other school fees, and childcare,” a subcategory of the broader Education index, and tracks out-of-pocket costs for tuition, school fees, and childcare.          - It's a subcategory of the broader \"Tuition, other school fees, and childcare\" which is part of the \"Education\" category.",
    "It subtracts scholarships and grants, so the reported cost reflects what people really pay after financial aid.",
    "Only degree-granting programs are included, such as associate’s, bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees.",
    "Changes in the quality of education — like more instruction time — are difficult to measure, so most tuition increases are treated as simple price increases unless the reason for the change is very clear.",
    "The index uses a base period of 1982–84, which is set to 100. Later values show how much prices have changed since then."
