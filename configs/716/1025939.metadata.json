    "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures inflation — how the average prices of goods and services change over time.",
    "The CPI’s housing category encompasses out-of-pocket expenses related to shelter and household operations, including rent, owners’ equivalent rent, utilities, and household furnishings.​",
    "It reflects the prices consumers actually pay, excluding mortgage interest, home purchase prices, or housing subsidies.​",
    "While adjustments are made for changes in housing quality (e.g., renovations or added amenities), most price changes are treated as direct inflation.​",
    "This category is a major driver of core inflation and provides insights into long-term cost-of-living trends.​",
    "The index uses a base period of 1982–84, which is set to 100. Later values show how much prices have changed since then."
