    "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures inflation — how the average prices of goods and services change over time.",
    "This CPI item tracks out-of-pocket costs for day care and preschool services.",
    "It includes charges for the care of pre-elementary school children, including pre-kindergarten educational programs.",
    "Individuals whose occupation is to regularly care for pre-elementary school children are included in the pricing.",
    "The item reflects changes over time in the cost of early childhood education and care.",
    "Separate charges for books, uniforms, transportation, or meals are not included.",
    "Short-term or occasional childcare (such as babysitting) and nanny services are excluded.",
    "Camp, kindergarten, and any programs for grade school students (including extended before- and after-school care) are also excluded.",
    "In families with more than three children, only the costs for up to three children are included; additional children are excluded from pricing.",
    "The index uses a base period of 1982–84, which is set to 100. Later values show how much prices have changed since then."
