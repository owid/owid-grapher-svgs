(2018) GPS)","unit":"","description":"Participants' risk preference was measured using both quantitative questions and a qualitative question. The quantitative question posed a series of 5 binary choices where participants chose between a fixed lottery (individual could win x or zero) and varying payments y (paid with certainty). \n\nChoice of the lottery resulted in an increase of the sure amount being offered in the next question, and vice versa, to determine an individual's certainty equivalent. \n\nThe qualitative question asks for the participant's self assessment of their willingness to take risks on an 11 point scale: \"In general, how willing are you to take risks?\"\n\nHigher values indicate the country average for risk taking is above the world average. \n\nThe qualitative and quantitative responses were combined using roughly equal weights.

This includes 15 countries from the Americas, 25 from Europe, 22 from Asia and the Pacific, and 14 African countries - 11 of which are Sub-Saharan. In total, this covers 90% of both the world population and total income. \n\nThe median sample size was 1,000 participants per country. The sample includes preference measures for over 80,000 participants altogether. \n\nCountry level averages for each economic preference were calculated using individual-level data weighted by the sampling weights provided by the Gallup World Poll. Each preference is normalized to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 in the individual-level data.\n\nFor more information on the construction of the GPS dataset, see Section II.A of the paper by Falk et al.
