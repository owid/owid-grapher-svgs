inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment \nand decent work for all \nTarget 8.4: Improve progressively, through 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption and \nproduction and endeavour to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation, in accordance \nwith the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production, with \ndeveloped countries taking the lead \nIndicator 8.4.2: Domestic material consumption, domestic material consumption per capita, and \ndomestic material consumption per GDP \n \n\nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \nUnited Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n \nDefinition: \nDomestic Material Consumption (DMC) is a standard material flow accounting (MFA) indicator and \nreports the apparent consumption of materials in a national economy.  \n \nRationale: \nDMC reports the amount of materials that are used in a national economy. DMC is a territorial \n(production side) indicator. DMC also presents the amount of material that needs to be handled within \nan economy, which is either added to material stocks of buildings and transport infrastructure or used to \nfuel the economy as material throughput. DMC describes the physical dimension of economic processes \nand interactions. It can also be interpreted as long-term waste equivalent. Per-capita DMC describes the \naverage level of material use in an economy – an environmental pressure indicator – and is also referred \nto as metabolic profile.  \n \nConcepts: \nDomestic Material Consumption (DMC) and MF need to be looked at in combination as they cover the \ntwo aspects of the economy, production and consumption. The DMC reports the actual amount of \nmaterial in an economy, MF the virtual amount required across the whole supply chain to service final \ndemand. A country can, for instance have a very high DMC because it has a large primary production \nsector for export or a very low DMC because it has outsourced most of the material intensive industrial \nprocess to other countries. The material footprint corrects for both phenomena.  \n \nComments and limitations: \nDMC cannot be disaggregated to economic sectors which limits its potential to become a satellite \naccount to the System of National Accounts (SNA).  \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \n\n\fLast updated: 12 February 2018 \n\nIt is calculated as direct imports (IM) of material plus domestic extraction (DE) of materials minus direct \nexports (EX) of materials measured in metric tonnes. DMC measure the amount of materials that are \nused in economic processes. It does not include materials that are mobilized the process of domestic \nextraction but do not enter the economic process. DMC is based on official economic statistics and it \nrequires some modelling to adapt the source data to the methodological requirements of the MFA. The \naccounting standard and accounting methods are set out in the EUROSTAT guidebooks for MFA accounts \nin the latest edition of 2013. MFA accounting is also part of the central framework of the System  of \nintegrated Environmental-Economic Accounts (SEEA).  \n \nDisaggregation: \nThe DMC indicator can be disaggregated into imports, domestic extraction and exports by a large number \nof material follow categories. At the highest level of aggregation biomass, fossil fuels, metal ores and \nnon-metallic minerals are distinguished. DMC is usually reported for 11 material categories, DE for 44 \nmaterial categories.  \n \nTreatment of missing values: \n \n\n•  At country level \n\nA zero is imputed when no positive real value was officially recorded, in the base data sets used, for any \nof the underlying components which make up this aggregated total. Thus “0.0” can represent either NA, \nor a genuine 0.0, or (crucially) a combination of both, which is a common situation. This allows for values \nto be easily aggregated into further aggregations; however, it should be thus noted that due to imputing \nmissing values as ‘0.0’, the aggregations may represent a lower value than actual situation.   \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\nSimilarly, missing values are imputed as zero in the regional and global aggregations. However, in the \ncase where no data is available at all for a particular country then the per capita and per GDP estimates \nare weighted averages of the available data.  \n\n \n\n \n\nRegional aggregates: \nSee: http://uneplive.unep.org/media/docs/graphs/aggregation_methods.pdf \n \nSources of discrepancies: \n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \nThe global material flows database is based on country material flow accounts from the European Union \nand Japan and estimated data for the rest of the world. Estimated data is produced on the bases of data \navailable from different national or international datasets in the domain of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, \nmining and energy statistics. International statistical sources for DMC and MF include the IEA, USGS, FAO \nand COMTRADE databases.  \n \nCollection process: \nThe IRP Global Material Flows and Resource Productivity working group compiles the data from countries \nand from other sources. \n\n\fLast updated: 12 February 2018 \n\n \n \nData Availability \n\n \nDescription: \nThe data covers more than 170 countries.  \n \nTime series: \nThe data set covers each nation individually, over a time period of 47 years (1970-2017). \n \nCalendar \n\n \nData collection: \nUnder discussion \n \nData release: \n11 September 2017 \n \nData providers \n\nNational Statistical Offices  \n \nData compilers \n\nUNEP, OECD and EUROSTAT \n \nReferences \n\n \nURL: \n \nReferences: \nEUROSTAT (2013).
