The official death toll was 573 people, all of which were premature deaths from evacuation and displacement of populations in the surrounding area: \n\nIn 2018, the Japanese government reported that one worker has since died from lung cancer as a result of exposure from the event: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-45423575\n\nEstimates for Fukushima have been derived from the WHO (2013; 2016), and official death toll from the Government of Japan.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) Report published five years on, suggests very low risk of increased cancer deaths in Japan. In a review of the response and long-term health impacts of Fukushima, published by Michael Reich and Aya Goto in The Lancet (2015), the authors note that: “no one has died from radiation exposure, and the UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation report in 2013 stated that substantial changes in future cancer statistics attributed to radiation exposure are not expected to be observed\".\n\nSources:\n\nWorld Health Organisation (2013).
