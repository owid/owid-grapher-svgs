    "The AI Incident Database (AIID) tracks cases of ethical misuse of AI, such as fatal accidents or wrongful arrests caused by AI systems.",
    "It relies on public media reports, so the actual number of incidents is likely underreported.",
    "In 2024, there was active discussion around how to define and track “serious” incidents, but no agreed standard has emerged.",
    "These conversations highlight the need for better reporting to more accurately document AI-related risks and their consequences.",
    "The number of AI incidents is continuously updated, including for past years, so the numbers reported here may differ from the latest figures on the AI Incident Database."
