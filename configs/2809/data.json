Only women who provide a “yes” \nanswer to all three components are considered as women who “make her own decisions regarding sexual \nand reproductive”. \n \nWomen’s autonomy in decision-making and exercise of their reproductive rights is assessed from \nresponses to the following three questions: \n\n1.

Who usually makes decisions about health care for yourself?  \n\n–  YOU,  \n–  YOUR (HUSBAND/PARTNER),  \n–  YOU AND YOUR (HUSBAND/PARTNER) JOINTLY,   \n–  SOMEONE ELSE? \n\n \nA woman is considered to have autonomy in reproductive health decision making and to be empowered \nto exercise their reproductive rights if they (1) can say “NO’ to sex with their husband/partner if they do \nnot want to, (2) decide on use/ non-use of contraception and (3) decide on health care for themselves.  \n \nRationale: \n\n \n\n \n\n\fLast updated: 25 March 2019 \n\nWomen’s and girls’ autonomy in decision making over consensual sexual relations, contraceptive use and \naccess to sexual and reproductive health services is key to their empowerment and the full exercise of \ntheir reproductive rights.   \n \nA woman’s ability to say “no” to her husband/partner if she does not want to have sexual intercourse is \nwell aligned with the concept of sexual autonomy and women’s empowerment. \n \nRegarding decision-making on use of contraception, the expert views as well as the initial data charts for \nseveral countries indicated that a clearer understanding of women empowerment is obtained by looking \nat the indicator from the perspective of decisions being made “mainly by the partner”, as opposed to \ndecision being made “by the woman alone” or “by the woman jointly with the partner”. Depending in the \ntype of contraceptive method being used, a decision by the woman “alone” or “jointly with the partner” \ndoes not always entail that the woman is empowered or has bargaining skills. Conversely, it is safe to \nassume that a woman that does not participate, at all, in making contraceptive choices is disempowered \nas far as sexual and reproductive decisions are concerned.  \n \nWomen who make their own decision regarding seeking healthcare for themselves are considered \nempowered to exercise their reproductive rights. \n \nConcepts: \nA union involves a man and a woman regularly cohabiting in a marriage-like relationship.  \n \nComments and limitations: \nA key limitation is that current estimates of the indicator are based on currently married or in union \nwomen of reproductive age (15-49 years old) who are using any type of contraception.  In the current \nDHS, the question on decision-making on use of contraception is only asked to women who are currently \nusing contraception. Because the questions on decision- making on sexual relations and health care are \nrestricted to women (15-49) currently married or in union, the denominator for Indicator 5.6.1 is women \n15-49, who are currently married or in union and currently using contraception.  \n \nHowever, agreement has been reached with Macro/ICF for upcoming DHS surveys to ask the question on \ndecision on use of contraception to all married/ in union women aged 15-49 years, whether they are \ncurrently using any contraception or not. The DHS model questionnaire for Phase 7 already includes the \nquestion on decision-making for women who are not currently using any contraception (DHS7 Woman’s \nQuestionnaire, 17 May 2016 version, Q820.) \n \nIn many national contexts, household surveys, which are the main data source for this indicator, exclude \nthe homeless and are likely to under-enumerate linguistic or religious minority groups. \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \nNumerator: Number of married or in union women aged 15-49 years old: \n\n–  who can say “no” to sex; and  \n– \n– \n\nfor whom the decision on contraception is not mainly made by the husband/partner; and  \nfor whom decision on health care for themselves is not usually made by the husband/partner or \nsomeone else \n\nOnly women who satisfy all three empowerment criteria are included in the numerator.   \n  \nDenominator: Total number women aged 15-49 years old, who are married or in union.  \n \nProportion = (Numerator/Denominator) * 100 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fLast updated: 25 March 2019 \n\n \nDisaggregation: \nBased on available DHS data, disaggregation is possible by age, geographic location, place of residence, \neducation, and wealth quintile.  \n \nTreatment of missing values: \n\n•  At country level \n\n \nNo attempt from UNFPA to provide and publish estimates for individual countries or areas when country \nor area data are not available.  \n \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\n \nRegional aggregates are based on countries where data are available within the region. They should not \nbe treated as country-level estimates for countries with missing values within the region.  \n \n \nRegional aggregates: \nGlobal and regional aggregates are computed as weighted averages of country level data. The weighting \nis based on the estimated population of married women aged 15-49, who are using any type of \ncontraception in the reporting year. The estimates of number of women married/ in union and \ncontraceptive prevalence rate are obtained from UN Population Division1.  \n \n \nSources of discrepancies: \nNot applicable. \n \n \n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \nCurrent data on the indicator are derived from nationally representative demographic and surveys (DHS).  \nPlans are underway to broaden the data sources to include MICS and other country specific surveys.  \n \nCollection process: \nData is collected in line with the methodology used for the relevant national survey.  \n \nData Availability \n\n \nDescription: \nThe Indicator is measured from demographic and health surveys (DHS) covering selected of low and \nmiddle income countries. Currently data for Indicator 5.6.1 is available as follows:  \n \n\n                                                           \n1 United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2016).

However, currently the question has been \nrestricted to married or in union women (15-49 years) who are using contraception. For the \nDHS7 and later rounds, the question will be extended to all married or in union women, whether \nthey are using family planning or not. \n\n•  Currently there is no DHS that includes the question on decision-making for reproductive health \ncare: “Who usually makes decisions about reproductive health care for yourself/ in line with the \naspiration of the indicator 5.6.1. However, DHS in 65 countries include the question “Who usually \nmakes decisions about HEALTH care for yourself?” which is asked to women who are married or \nin union.  \n\n \nCurrently, a total of 51 countries have at least one survey with data on all the 3 questions above which \nare necessary for calculating Indicator 5.6.1.  The 51 countries with data are distributed as follows:  \n\n•  Central Asia and Southern Asia (3) \n•  Eastern Asia and South-eastern Asia (4)  \n•  Northern America and Europe (2) \n•  Western Asia and Northern Africa (2) \nLatin America and the Caribbean (5)  \n• \nSub-Saharan Africa (35) \n• \n\n \nSeveral other countries have only one or two of the three questions needed to calculate Indicator 5.6.1. \nUNFPA will engage with MICS, other organizations and agencies to incorporate the relevant questions in \nother national surveys with a view to covering all countries on a global scale.  \n \nTime series: \nCurrently data comes from the DHS which have three to five- year cycles. \n \nCalendar \n\n \nData collection: \nAs per DHS, MICS and national survey cycles \n \nData release: \nOn-going as new data becomes available  \n \nData providers \n\n \nAgencies responsible for the DHS at national level. \n \nData compilers \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fLast updated: 25 March 2019 \n\nUNFPA  \n \nReferences \n\n \nURL:  \nNot available. \n \nReferences: \nNot available. \n \nRelated indicators \n\n \nIndicator 5.6.2 \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f"}}},"entityKey":{"16":{"name":"Albania","code":"ALB"},"19":{"name":"Angola","code":"AGO"},"22":{"name":"Armenia","code":"ARM"},"32":{"name":"Benin","code":"BEN"},"40":{"name":"Burkina Faso","code":"BFA"},"41":{"name":"Burundi","code":"BDI"},"42":{"name":"Cambodia","code":"KHM"},"43":{"name":"Cameroon","code":"CMR"},"60":{"name":"Zambia","code":"ZMB"},"64":{"name":"Tanzania","code":"TZA"},"67":{"name":"Ukraine","code":"UKR"},"68":{"name":"Uganda","code":"UGA"},"74":{"name":"Togo","code":"TGO"},"76":{"name":"Tajikistan","code":"TJK"},"78":{"name":"Eswatini","code":"SWZ"},"80":{"name":"Zimbabwe","code":"ZWE"},"87":{"name":"Sierra Leone","code":"SLE"},"89":{"name":"Senegal","code":"SEN"},"91":{"name":"Rwanda","code":"RWA"},"96":{"name":"Philippines","code":"PHL"},"103":{"name":"Nigeria","code":"NGA"},"104":{"name":"Niger","code":"NER"},"107":{"name":"Nepal","code":"NPL"},"108":{"name":"Namibia","code":"NAM"},"109":{"name":"Mozambique","code":"MOZ"},"115":{"name":"Mali","code":"MLI"},"117":{"name":"Malawi","code":"MWI"},"118":{"name":"Madagascar","code":"MDG"},"121":{"name":"Liberia","code":"LBR"},"123":{"name":"Lesotho","code":"LSO"},"126":{"name":"Kyrgyzstan","code":"KGZ"},"129":{"name":"Kenya","code":"KEN"},"130":{"name":"Jordan","code":"JOR"},"139":{"name":"Honduras","code":"HND"},"142":{"name":"Myanmar","code":"MMR"},"143":{"name":"Cote d'Ivoire","code":"CIV"},"145":{"name":"Haiti","code":"HTI"},"146":{"name":"Guyana","code":"GUY"},"147":{"name":"Guinea","code":"GIN"},"148":{"name":"Guatemala","code":"GTM"},"150":{"name":"Ghana","code":"GHA"},"151":{"name":"Gambia","code":"GMB"},"153":{"name":"Gabon","code":"GAB"},"158":{"name":"Ethiopia","code":"ETH"},"160":{"name":"Dominican Republic","code":"DOM"},"167":{"name":"Democratic Republic of Congo","code":"COD"},"168":{"name":"Congo","code":"COG"},"169":{"name":"Comoros","code":"COM"},"173":{"name":"Chad","code":"TCD"},"225":{"name":"Timor","code":"TLS"},"232":{"name":"Sao Tome and Principe","code":"STP"},"273":{"name":"Africa","code":null},"275":{"name":"Asia","code":null},"276":{"name":"Europe","code":null},"289":{"name":"Sub-Saharan Africa","code":null},"290":{"name":"Americas","code":null},"295":{"name":"South America","code":null},"355":{"name":"World","code":"OWID_WRL"},"431":{"name":"Asia, Central","code":null},"436":{"name":"Caribbean","code":null},"462":{"name":"Eastern Africa","code":null},"463":{"name":"Middle Africa","code":null},"465":{"name":"Southern Africa","code":null},"466":{"name":"Western Africa","code":null},"470":{"name":"Southern Asia","code":null},"472":{"name":"Western Asia","code":null},"473":{"name":"Eastern Europe","code":null},"475":{"name":"Southern Europe","code":null},"477":{"name":"Central America","code":null},"5404":{"name":"Landlocked developing countries","code":null},"36360":{"name":"South Eastern Asia","code":null},"36458":{"name":"Europe and Northern America","code":null},"36460":{"name":"Central and Southern Asia","code":null},"36461":{"name":"Eastern and South-Eastern Asia","code":null},"36463":{"name":"Northern Africa and Western Asia","code":null},"38228":{"name":"Least Developed Countries (LDCs)","code":null},"38229":{"name":"Small Island Developing States (SIDS)","code":null},"90620":{"name":"Latin America and the Caribbean\t","code":null}}}
