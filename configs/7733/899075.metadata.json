  "descriptionShort": "The [Gini coefficient](#dod:gini) measures inequality on a scale from 0 to 1. Higher values indicate higher inequality.",
  "descriptionFromProducer": "The Gini coefficient is based on the comparison of cumulative proportions of the population against cumulative proportions of income they receive, and it ranges between 0 in the case of perfect equality and 1 in the case of perfect inequality.\n\nThe Gini coefficient for market income refers to income before taxes and transfers. However, data for China, Hungary, Mexico and Turkey as well as data for Greece from the Household Budget Survey refer to the income post taxes and before transfers.\n\nData calculated according to the new OECD Terms of reference. Compared to previous terms of reference, these include a more detailed breakdown of current transfers received and paid by households as well as a revised definition of household income, including the value of goods produced for own consumption as an element of self-employed income.\n\nThe OECD Income Distribution database (IDD) has been developed to benchmark and monitor countries’ performance in the field of income inequality and poverty. It contains a number of standardised indicators based on the central concept of “equivalised household disposable income”, i.e. the total income received by the households less the current taxes and transfers they pay, adjusted for household size with an equivalence scale. While household income is only one of the factors shaping people’s economic well-being, it is also the one for which comparable data for all OECD countries are most common. Income distribution has a long-standing tradition among household-level statistics, with regular data collections going back to the 1980s (and sometimes earlier) in many OECD countries.\n\nAchieving comparability in this field is a challenge, as national practices differ widely in terms of concepts, measures, and statistical sources. In order to maximise international comparability as well as inter-temporal consistency of data, the IDD data collection and compilation process is based on a common set of statistical conventions (e.g. on income concepts and components). The information obtained by the OECD through a network of national data providers, via a standardized questionnaire, is based on national sources that are deemed to be most representative for each country.\n\nSmall changes in estimates between years should be treated with caution as they may not be statistically significant.",
