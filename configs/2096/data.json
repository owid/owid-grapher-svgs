Index \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \nInternational Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) \nBirdLife International (BLI) \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n \nDefinition: \nThe Red List Index measures change in aggregate extinction risk across groups of species. It is based on \ngenuine changes in the number of species in each category of extinction risk on The IUCN Red List of \nThreatened Species (IUCN 2015) is expressed as changes in an index ranging from 0 to 1. \n \nRationale: \nThe world’s species are impacted by a number of threatening processes, including habitat destruction \nand degradation, overexploitation, invasive alien species, human disturbance, pollution and climate \nchange. This indicator can be used to assess overall changes in the extinction risk of groups of species as a \nresult of these threats and the extent to which threats are being mitigated. \n \nThe Red List Index value ranges from 1 (all species are categorized as ‘Least Concern’) to 0 (all species are \ncategorized as ‘Extinct’), and so indicates how far the set of species has moved overall towards \nextinction. Thus, the Red List Index allows comparisons between sets of species in both their overall level \nof extinction risk (i.e., how threatened they are on average), and in the rate at which this risk changes \nover time. A downward trend in the Red List Index over time means that the expected rate of future \nspecies extinctions is worsening (i.e., the rate of biodiversity loss is increasing). An upward trend means \nthat the expected rate of species extinctions is abating (i.e., the rate of biodiversity loss is decreasing), \nand a horizontal line means that the expected rate of species extinctions is remaining the same, although \nin each of these cases it does not mean that biodiversity loss has stopped. An upward Red List Index \ntrend would indicate that the SDG Target 15.5 of reducing the degradation of natural habitats and \nprotecting threatened species is on track. A Red List Index value of 1 would indicate that biodiversity loss \nhas been halted. \n \nThe name “Red List Index” should not be taken to imply that the indicator is produced as a composite \nindicator of a number of disparate metrics (in the same way that, e.g., the Multidimensional Poverty \nIndex is compiled). The Red List Index provides an indicator of trends in species’ extinction risk, as \nmeasured using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (Mace et al. 2008, IUCN 2012a), and is compiled \nfrom data on changes over time in the Red List Category for each species, excluding any changes driven \nby improved knowledge or revised taxonomy. \n \n\n\fLast updated: 11 July 2017 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Red List Index is used as an indicator towards the 2011–2020 Strategic Plan for Biodiversity (CBD \n2014, Tittensor et al. 2014), and was used as an indicator towards the Convention on Biological \nDiversity’s 2010 Target (Butchart et al. 2010) and Millennium Development Goal 7. It can also be \nprojected to assess future development scenarios (Visconti et al. 2015). \n \nConcepts: \nThreatened species are those listed on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in the categories \nVulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered (i.e., species that are facing a high, very high, or \nextremely high risk of extinction in the wild in the medium-term future). Changes over time in the \nproportion of species threatened with extinction are largely driven by improvements in knowledge and \nchanging taxonomy. The indicator excludes such changes to yield a more informative indicator than the \nsimple proportion of threatened species. It therefore measures change in aggregate extinction risk across \ngroups of species over time, resulting from genuine improvements or deteriorations in the status of \nindividual species. It can be calculated for any representative set of species that have been assessed for \nThe IUCN Red List of Threatened Species at least twice (Butchart et al. 2004, 2005, 2007). \n \nComments and limitations: \nThere are four main sources of uncertainty associated with Red List Index values and trends. \n \n\na. \n\nInadequate,  incomplete  or  inaccurate  knowledge  of  a  species’  status.  This  uncertainty  is \nminimized by assigning estimates of extinction risk to categories that are broad in magnitude and \ntiming. \n\nb.  Delays in knowledge about a species becoming available for assessment. Such delays apply to a \nsmall (and diminishing) proportion of status changes, and can be overcome in the Red List Index \nthrough back-casting. \n\nc. \n\nInconsistency  between  species  assessments.  These  can  be  minimized  by  the  requirement  to \nprovide supporting documentation detailing the best available data, with justifications, sources, \nand  estimates  of  uncertainty  and  data  quality,  which  are  checked  and  standardized  by  IUCN \nthrough Red List Authorities, a Red List Technical Working Group and an independent Standards \nand Petitions Sub-committee. Further, detailed Guidelines on the Application of the Categories \nand Criteria are maintained (IUCN SPSC 2016), as is an online training course (in English, Spanish \nand French). \n\nd.  Species that are too poorly known for the Red List Criteria to be applied are assigned to the Data \nDeficient category, and excluded from the calculation of the Red List Index. For birds, only 0.8% \nof  extant  species  are  evaluated  as  Data  Deficient,  compared  with  24%  of  amphibians.  If  Data \nDeficient  species  differ  in  the  rate  at  which  their extinction risk  is  changing,  the Red  List  Index \nmay give a biased picture of the changing extinction risk of the overall set of species. The degree \nof  uncertainty  this  introduces  is  estimated  through  a  bootstrapping  procedure  that  randomly \nassigns  each  Data  Deficient  species  a  category  based  on  the  numbers  of  non-Data  Deficient \nspecies in each Red List category for the set of species under consideration, and repeats this for \n1,000 iterations, plotting the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles as lower and upper confidence intervals for \nthe median. \n\n \nThe main limitation of the Red List Index is related to the fact that the Red List Categories are relatively \nbroad measures of status, and thus the Red List Index for any individual taxonomic group can practically \nbe updated at intervals of at least four years. As the overall index is aggregated across multiple \ntaxonomic groups, it can be updated typically annually. In addition, the Red List Index does not capture \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 11 July 2017 \n\nparticularly well the deteriorating status of common species that remain abundant and widespread but \nare declining slowly. \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \nThe Red List Index is calculated at a point in time by first multiplying the number of species in each Red \nList Category by a weight (ranging from 1 for ‘Near Threatened’ to 5 for ‘Extinct’ and ‘Extinct in the Wild’) \nand summing these values. This is then divided by a maximum threat score which is the total number of \nspecies multiplied by the weight assigned to the ‘Extinct’ category. This final value is subtracted from 1 to \ngive the Red List Index value. \n \nMathematically this calculation is expressed as:  \nRLIt = 1 – [(Ss Wc(t,s) / (WEX * N)] \nWhere Wc(t,s) is the weight for category (c) at time (t) for species (s) (the weight for ‘Critically \nEndangered’ = 4, ‘Endangered’ = 3, ‘Vulnerable’ = 2, ‘Near Threatened’ = 1, ‘Least Concern’ = 0. ‘Critically \nEndangered’ species tagged as ‘Possibly Extinct’ or ‘Possibly Extinct in the Wild’ are assigned a weight of \n5); WEX = 5, the weight assigned to ‘Extinct’ or ‘Extinct in the Wild’ species; and N is the total number of \nassessed species, excluding those assessed as Data Deficient in the current time period, and those \nconsidered to be ‘Extinct’ in the year the set of species was first assessed. \n \nThe formula requires that: \n\n• \n• \n\nExactly the same set of species is included in all time periods, and \nThe only Red List Category changes are those resulting from genuine improvement or \ndeterioration in status (i.e., excluding changes resulting from improved knowledge or taxonomic \nrevisions), and \n\n•  Data Deficient species are excluded. \n\n \nIn many cases, species lists will change slightly from one assessment to the next (e.g., owing to taxonomic \nrevisions). The conditions can therefore be met by retrospectively adjusting earlier Red List \ncategorizations using current information and taxonomy. This is achieved by assuming that the current \nRed List Categories for the taxa have applied since the set of species was first assessed for the Red List, \nunless there is information to the contrary that genuine status changes have occurred. Such information \nis often contextual (e.g., relating to the known history of habitat loss within the range of the species). If \nthere is insufficient information available for a newly added species, it is not incorporated into the Red \nList Index until it is assessed for a second time, at which point earlier assessments are retrospectively \ncorrected by extrapolating recent trends in population, range, habitat and threats, supported by \nadditional information. To avoid spurious results from biased selection of species, Red List Indices are \ntypically calculated only for taxonomic groups in which all species worldwide have been assessed for the \nRed List, or for samples of species that have been systematically or randomly selected. \n \nThe methods and scientific basis for the Red List Index were described by Butchart et al. (2004, 2005, \n2007, 2010).  \n \nButchart et al. (2010) also described the methods by which Red List Indices for different taxonomic \ngroups are aggregated to produce a single multi-taxon Red List Index. Specifically, aggregated Red List \nIndices are calculated as the arithmetic mean of modelled Red List Indices. Red List Indices for each \n\n\fLast updated: 11 July 2017 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ntaxonomic group are interpolated linearly for years between data points and extrapolated linearly (with a \nslope equal to that between the two closest assessed points) to align them with years for which Red List \nIndices for other taxa are available. The Red List Indices for each taxonomic group for each year are \nmodelled to take into account various sources of uncertainty:  \n \n\ni)  Data  Deficiency:  Red  List  categories  (from  Least  Concern  to  Extinct)  are  assigned  to  all  Data \nDeficient species, with a probability proportional to the number of species in non-Data Deficient \ncategories for that taxonomic group;  \n\nii)  Extrapolation  uncertainty:  although  RLIs  were  extrapolated  linearly  based  on  the  slope  of  the \nclosest  two  assessed  point,  there  is  uncertainty  about  how  accurate  this  slope  may  be.  To \nincorporate  this  uncertainty,  rather  than  extrapolating  deterministically,  the  slope  used  for \nextrapolation is selected from a normal distribution with a probability equal to the slope of the \nclosest  two  assessed  points,  and  standard  deviation  equal  to  60%  of  this  slope  (i.e.,  the  CV  is \n60%);  \n\niii)  Temporal  variability:  the  ‘true’  Red  List  Index  likely  changes  from  year  to  year,  but  because \nassessments are repeated only at multi-year intervals, the precise value for any particular year is \nuncertain.  \n\n \nTo make this uncertainty explicit, the Red List Index value for a given taxonomic group in a given year is \nassigned from a moving window of five years, centred on the focal year (with the window set as 3-4 years \nfor the first two and last two years in the series). Note that assessment uncertainty cannot yet be \nincorporated into the index. Practically, these uncertainties are incorporated into the aggregated Red List \nIndices as follows: Data Deficient species were allotted a category as described above, and a Red List \nIndex for each taxonomic group was calculated interpolating and extrapolating as described above. A \nfinal Red List Index value was assigned to each taxonomic group for each year from a window of years as \ndescribed above. Each such ‘run’ produced a Red List Index for the complete time period for each \ntaxonomic group, incorporating the various sources of uncertainty. Ten thousand such runs are \ngenerated for each taxonomic group, and the mean is calculated. \n \nMethods for generating national disaggregations of the Red List Index are described below. \n \nDisaggregation: \nThe Red List Index can be downscaled to show national and regional Red List Indices, weighted by the \nfraction of each species’ distribution occurring within the country or region, building on the method \npublished by Rodrigues et al. (2014) PLoS ONE 9(11): e113934. These show an index of aggregate survival \nprobability (the inverse of extinction risk) for all birds, mammals, amphibians, corals and cycads occurring \nwithin the country or region. The index shows how well species are conserved in a country or region to its \npotential contribution to global species conservation. The index is calculated as:  \n \nRLI(t,u) = 1 – [(Ss(W(t,s) * (rsu/Rs)) / (WEX * Ss (rsu/Rs)) \n \nwhere t is the year of comprehensive reassessment, u is the spatial unit (i.e. country), W_((t,s)) is the \nweight of the global Red List category for species s at time t (Least Concern =0, Near Threatened =1, \nVulnerable =2, Endangered =3, Critically Endangered =4, Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) =5, \nCritically Endangered (Possibly Extinct in the Wild) =5, Extinct in the Wild =5 and Extinct =5), WEX = 5 is \nthe weight for Extinct species, r_su is the fraction of the total range of species s in unit u, and R_s is the \ntotal range size of species s. \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 11 July 2017 \n\n \nThe index varies from 1 if the country has contributed the minimum it can to the global RLI (i.e., if the \nnumerator is 0 because all species in the country are LC) to 0 if the country has contributed the maximum \nit can to the global RLI (i.e., if the numerator equals the denominator because all species in the country \nare Extinct or Possibly Extinct).  \n \nThe taxonomic groups included are those in which all species have been assessed for the IUCN Red List \nmore than once. Red List categories for years in which comprehensive assessments (i.e. those in which all \nspecies in the taxonomic group have been assessed) were carried out are determined following the \napproach of Butchart et al. 2007; PLoS ONE 2(1): e140, i.e. they match the current categories except for \nthose taxa that have undergone genuine improvement or deterioration in extinction risk of sufficient \nmagnitude to qualify for a higher or lower Red List category. \n \nThe indicator can also be disaggregated by ecosystems, habitats, and other political and geographic \ndivisions (e.g., Han et al. 2014), by taxonomic subsets (e.g., Hoffmann et al. 2011), by suites of species \nrelevant to particular international treaties or legislation (e.g., Croxall et al. 2012), by suites of species \nexposed to particular threatening processes (e.g., Butchart 2008), and by suites of species that deliver \nparticular ecosystem services, or have particular biological or life-history traits (e.g., Regan et al. 2015). In \neach case, information can be obtained from The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species to determine \nwhich species are relevant to particular subsets (e.g. which occur in particular ecosystems, habitats, and \ngeographic areas of interest). \n \nDisaggregations of the Red List Index are also of particular relevance as indicators towards the following \nSDG targets (Brooks et al. 2015): SDG 2.4 Red List Index (species used for food and medicine); SDG 2.5 \nRed List Index (wild relatives and local breeds); SDG 12.2 Red List Index (impacts of utilisation) (Butchart \n2008); SDG 12.4 Red List Index (impacts of pollution); SDG 13.1 Red List Index (impacts of climate \nchange); SDG 14.1 Red List Index (impacts of pollution on marine species); SDG 14.2 Red List Index \n(marine species); SDG 14.3 Red List Index (reef-building coral species) (Carpenter et al. 2008); SDG 14.4 \nRed List Index (impacts of utilisation on marine species) – an ad hoc joint FAO-IUCN Technical Expert \nGroup is currently working to develop agreed recommendations on the use and interpretation of this \nindicator; SDG 15.1 Red List Index (terrestrial & freshwater species); SDG 15.2 Red List Index (forest-\nspecialist species); SDG 15.4 Red List Index (mountain species); SDG 15.7 Red List Index (impacts of \nutilisation) (Butchart 2008); and SDG 15.8 Red List Index (impacts of invasive alien species) (Butchart \n2008, McGeoch et al. 2010). \n \nTreatment of missing values: \n\n•  At country level \n\nRed List Indices for each taxonomic group are interpolated linearly for years between data points \nand extrapolated linearly (with a slope equal to that between the two closest assessed points, \nexcept for corals) back to the earliest time point and forwards to the present for years for which \nestimates are not available. The start year of the aggregated index is set as ten years before the \nfirst assessment year for the taxonomic group with the latest starting point. Corals are not \nextrapolated linearly because declines are known to have been much steeper subsequent to 1996 \n(owing to extreme bleaching events) than before. Therefore the rate of decline prior to 1996 is set \nas the average of the rates for the other taxonomic groups. \n \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 11 July 2017 \n\nThe Red List Index is calculated globally based on assessments of extinction risk of each species \nincluded, because many species have distributions which span many countries. Thus, while there is \ncertainly uncertainty around the Red List Index, there are no missing values as such, and so no \nimputation is necessary. \n \n\nRegional aggregates: \nThe Red List Categories and Criteria are applied for each species on The IUCN Red List of Threatened \nSpecies and are determined globally and provided principally by the Specialist Groups and stand-alone \nRed List Authorities of the IUCN Species Survival Commission, IUCN Secretariat-led initiatives, the BirdLife \nInternational partnership, and the other IUCN Red List partner organizations. The staff of the IUCN Global \nSpecies Programme compile, validate, and curate these data, and are responsible for publishing and \ncommunicating the results. Each individual species assessment is supported by the application of \nmetadata and documentation standards (IUCN 2013), including classifications of, for example, threats \nand conservation actions (Salafsky et al. 2008).  \n \nRed List assessments are undertaken through either open workshops or through open-access web-based \ndiscussion fora. Assessments are reviewed by the appropriate Red List Authority (an individual or \norganization appointed by the IUCN Species Survival Commission to review assessments for specific \nspecies or groups of species) to ensure standardisation and consistency in the interpretation of \ninformation and application of the criteria. A Red List Technical Working Group and the IUCN Red List \nUnit work to ensure consistent categorization between species, groups and assessments. Finally, a \nStandards and Petitions Sub-committee monitors the process and resolves challenges and disputes over \nRed List assessments. \n \nIn addition, IUCN publishes guidelines on applying the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria at regional or \nnational scales (IUCN 2012b). Based on these, many countries have initiated programmes to assess the \nextinction risk of species occurring within their borders. These countries will be able to implement the \nRed List Index based on national extinction risk, once they have carried out at least two national Red Lists \nusing the IUCN system in a consistent way (Bubb et al. 2009). An increasing number of countries have \nnow completed national Red List Indices for a range of taxa (e.g., Gärdenfors 2010, Pihl & Flensted 2011). \n \nWhile global Red List Indices can be disaggregated to show trends for species at smaller spatial scales, the \nreverse is not true. National or regional Red List Indices cannot be aggregated to produce Red List Indices \nshowing global trends. This is because a taxon’s global extinction risk has to be evaluated at the global \nscale and cannot be directly determined from multiple national scale assessments across its range \n(although the data from such assessments can be aggregated for inclusion in the global assessment). \n \nSources of discrepancies: \nSome countries have assessed the national extinction risk of species occurring in the country, and have \nrepeated such assessments, allowing a national Red List Index to be produced. This may differ from the \nindicator described here because (a) it considers national rather than global extinction risk, and (b) \nbecause it takes no account of the national responsibility for the conservation of each species, treating as \nequal both those species that occur nowhere outside the country (i.e. national endemics) and those with \nlarge ranges that occur in many other countries. Any such differences will be smaller for countries within \nwhich a high proportion of species are endemic (i.e., only found in that country), as in many island \nnations and mountainous countries, especially in the tropics. The differences will be larger for countries \nwithin which a high proportion of species have widespread distributions across many nations. \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 11 July 2017 \n\n \nMethods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level: \nSee existing metadata for the Red List Index SDG indicator 15.5.1, especially the section on \n“Methodology”. In sum: the data underlying the Red List Index are compiled under the authority of the \nIUCN Red List Committee, through application of the IUCN Red List Categories & Criteria \n(https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10315). This includes submissions of endemics from national red \nlist processes, where these have been conducted following the “Guidelines for application of IUCN Red \nList Criteria at Regional and National Levels” (https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10336) and following \nthe “Required and Recommended Supporting Information for IUCN Red List Assessments” \n(http://goo.gl/O52euG). Assessments may be submitted in all three IUCN languages (English, French and \nSpanish) and Portuguese. All assessments are peer reviewed through the relevant Red List Authority for \nthe species or species group in question, as documented in the Red List Rules of Procedure \n(https://cmsdocs.s3.amazonaws.com/keydocuments/Rules_of_Procedure_for_IUCN_Red_List_Assessme\nnts_2017-2020.pdf); see in particular Annex 3, the “Details of the Steps Involved in the IUCN Red List \nProcess” \n(https://cmsdocs.s3.amazonaws.com/keydocuments/Details_of_the_Steps_Involved_in_the_IUCN_Red_\nList_Process.pdf). \n \nSee existing metadata for the Red List Index SDG indicator 15.5.1, especially the section on \n“Methodology”.

Finally, the Chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission (elected each \nfour years by the government and non-governmental Members of IUCN) appoints a Chair for a Standards \nand Petitions Sub-Committee (https://www.iucn.org/theme/species/about/species-survival-\ncommission/ssc-leadership-and-steering-committee/sub-committees/standards-and-petitions-\n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 11 July 2017 \n\nsubcommittee), which is responsible for ensuring the quality and standards of the IUCN Red List and for \nruling on petitions against the listings of species on the IUCN Red List.  \n \nIn addition to dissemination via the Red List website (http://www.iucnredlist.org/), Red List data are \ndisseminated through the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool, available for research and \nconservation online (https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/). This incorporates Country Profile \ndocuments for all of the world’s countries, which includes documentation of the Red List Index indicator \nfor the current year, starting from 2016. The first edition of each of these Country Profiles was sent for \nconsultation to National Focal Points of the Convention on Biological Diversity \n(https://www.cbd.int/information/nfp.shtml), at the 13th meeting of the Conference of the Parties of the \nConvention on Biological Diversity; and this process will be repeated annually. \n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \nNational agencies producing relevant data include government, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), \nand academic institutions working jointly and separately. Data are gathered from published and \nunpublished sources, species experts, scientists, and conservationists through correspondence, \nworkshops, and electronic fora. Data are submitted by national agencies to IUCN, or are gathered \nthrough initiatives of the Red List Partnership. From 2013–6, the Red List Partnership encompassed: \nBirdLife International; Botanic Gardens Conservation International; Conservation International; \nMicrosoft; NatureServe; Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; Sapienza University of Rome; Texas A&M \nUniversity; Wildscreen; and Zoological Society of London. \n \nCollection process: \nSee information under other categories. \n \nData Availability \n\n \nDescription: \nThe Red List Index has been classified by the IAEG-SDGs as Tier 1. Current data are available for all \ncountries in the world, and these are updated on a regular basis (approximately once every four years). \n \nTime series: \nSince 1980 (approximately 35 years).  \n \nCalendar \n\n \nData collection: \nThe IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is updated annually. Red List Indices for any sets of species that \nhave been comprehensively reassessed in that year are usually released alongside the update of the IUCN \nRed List. Data are stored and managed in the Species Information Service database, and are made freely \navailable for non-commercial use through the IUCN Red List website.
