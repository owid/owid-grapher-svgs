It is calculated by dividing the female value for the indicator by the male value for the indicator. A GPI equal to 1 indicates parity between females and males. In general, a value <1 indicates disparity in favor of males and a value >1 in favor of females. Gender parity is defined as a GPI between 0.97 and 1.03. Gender parity in developing regions (shown below) was achieved at all education levels.","hasMapTab":false,"stackMode":"absolute","dimensions":[{"display":{"shortUnit":"GPI"},"property":"y","variableId":97658}],"hasChartTab":true,"isPublished":true,"selectedData":[{"index":0,"entityId":37722},{"index":0,"entityId":37723},{"index":0,"entityId":37724}],"addCountryMode":"disabled","comparisonLines":[{"label":"Target: Gender Parity defined as GPI between 0.97 & 1.03","yEquals":"0.97"}],"hideRelativeToggle":true}
