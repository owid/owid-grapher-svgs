  "subtitle": "The gender parity index (GPI) is the ratio of the female to male net enrolment ratio for primary, secondary and tertiary education levels. It is calculated by dividing the female value for the indicator by the male value for the indicator. A GPI equal to 1 indicates parity between females and males. In general, a value <1 indicates disparity in favor of males and a value >1 in favor of females. Gender parity is defined as a GPI between 0.97 and 1.03. Gender parity in developing regions (shown below) was achieved at all education levels.",
