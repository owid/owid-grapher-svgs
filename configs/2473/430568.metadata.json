  "description": "Definition: Tourist alcohol per capita consumption (ACP) are the litres of pure alcohol which are consumed by tourists to a country in a calendar year. This figure is adjusted for the alcohol purchased and consumed when people are visiting countries other than their home country. Positive figures denote total alcohol consumption of outbound tourists being greater than total alcohol consumption by inbound tourists, negative numbers the opposite. Tourist consumption is based on UN tourist statistics, and data are provided by IHME. The three-year average of tourist APC is presented.\n\nMethod of estimation: The litres of alcohol consumed by tourists (15 years of age and older) in a country are based on the number of tourists who visited a country, the average amount of time they spent in the country, and how much these people drink on average in their countries of origin (estimated based on per capita consumption of recorded and unrecorded alcohol). Furthermore, tourist alcohol consumption also accounts for the inhabitants of a country consuming alcohol while visiting other countries (based on the average time spent outside of their country (for all people 15 years and older) and the amount of alcohol consumed in their country of origin.",
