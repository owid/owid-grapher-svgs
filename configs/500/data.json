A global chemical transport model was used to calculate a seasonal (summer, when temperatures are highest) average concentration. Variation in the timing of the ozone (summer) season in different parts of the world is accounted for in these datasets. Global exposure to PM2.5 is then systematically estimated based on blocks or grid cells covering 0.1° x 0.1° of longitude and latitude (approximately 11 km x 11 km at the equator).\n\nTaking into account the population in each block within a country, this data is then aggregated as estimated exposure concentrations to national-level population-weighted averages for a given
