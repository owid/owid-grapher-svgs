The Urbanization Prospects presents data on the number and share of the population residing in urban areas for each country from 1950 with projections to 2050.\n\nThere is no consistent definition of what constitutes an 'urban area'. This is highly variable across countries. This data presents a given country's minimum threshold of inhabitants needed for it to be defined an 'urban area'. For many countries, there is no defined threshold based on inhabitants; other metrics such as population density, infrastructure, or even pre-defined cities may be used.\n\nNote that some countries with minimum inhabitant thresholds noted here also include additional qualities (such as population density) to be met."}}},"entityKey":{"1":{"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GBR"},"2":{"name":"Ireland","code":"IRL"},"3":{"name":"France","code":"FRA"},"4":{"name":"Belgium","code":"BEL"},"5":{"name":"Netherlands","code":"NLD"},"7":{"name":"Switzerland","code":"CHE"},"8":{"name":"Italy","code":"ITA"},"9":{"name":"Spain","code":"ESP"},"10":{"name":"Sweden","code":"SWE"},"13":{"name":"United States","code":"USA"},"14":{"name":"Japan","code":"JPN"},"16":{"name":"Albania","code":"ALB"},"17":{"name":"Algeria","code":"DZA"},"21":{"name":"Argentina","code":"ARG"},"23":{"name":"Australia","code":"AUS"},"27":{"name":"Bahrain","code":"BHR"},"28":{"name":"Bangladesh","code":"BGD"},"32":{"name":"Benin","code":"BEN"},"33":{"name":"Bhutan","code":"BTN"},"34":{"name":"Bolivia","code":"BOL"},"36":{"name":"Botswana","code":"BWA"},"42":{"name":"Cambodia","code":"KHM"},"43":{"name":"Cameroon","code":"CMR"},"44":{"name":"Canada","code":"CAN"},"60":{"name":"Zambia","code":"ZMB"},"68":{"name":"Uganda","code":"UGA"},"71":{"name":"Tunisia","code":"TUN"},"77":{"name":"Syria","code":"SYR"},"79":{"name":"Sudan","code":"SDN"},"80":{"name":"Zimbabwe","code":"ZWE"},"82":{"name":"Somalia","code":"SOM"},"83":{"name":"Slovenia","code":"SVN"},"84":{"name":"Vietnam","code":"VNM"},"85":{"name":"Slovakia","code":"SVK"},"87":{"name":"Sierra Leone","code":"SLE"},"89":{"name":"Senegal","code":"SEN"},"90":{"name":"Saudi Arabia","code":"SAU"},"93":{"name":"Puerto Rico","code":"PRI"},"95":{"name":"Portugal","code":"PRT"},"96":{"name":"Philippines","code":"PHL"},"99":{"name":"Papua New Guinea","code":"PNG"},"100":{"name":"Panama","code":"PAN"},"102":{"name":"Norway","code":"NOR"},"103":{"name":"Nigeria","code":"NGA"},"105":{"name":"Nicaragua","code":"NIC"},"106":{"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZL"},"113":{"name":"Mexico","code":"MEX"},"114":{"name":"Mauritania","code":"MRT"},"115":{"name":"Mali","code":"MLI"},"116":{"name":"Malaysia","code":"MYS"},"118":{"name":"Madagascar","code":"MDG"},"121":{"name":"Liberia","code":"LBR"},"124":{"name":"Lebanon","code":"LBN"},"125":{"name":"Laos","code":"LAO"},"129":{"name":"Kenya","code":"KEN"},"130":{"name":"Jordan","code":"JOR"},"133":{"name":"Israel","code":"ISR"},"135":{"name":"Iran","code":"IRN"},"137":{"name":"India","code":"IND"},"139":{"name":"Honduras","code":"HND"},"140":{"name":"Palestine","code":"PSE"},"143":{"name":"Cote d'Ivoire","code":"CIV"},"149":{"name":"Greece","code":"GRC"},"150":{"name":"Ghana","code":"GHA"},"151":{"name":"Gambia","code":"GMB"},"153":{"name":"Gabon","code":"GAB"},"157":{"name":"Eritrea","code":"ERI"},"158":{"name":"Ethiopia","code":"ETH"},"159":{"name":"Equatorial Guinea","code":"GNQ"},"161":{"name":"Denmark","code":"DNK"},"162":{"name":"Czechia","code":"CZE"},"164":{"name":"Cuba","code":"CUB"},"165":{"name":"Croatia","code":"HRV"},"167":{"name":"Democratic Republic of Congo","code":"COD"},"169":{"name":"Comoros","code":"COM"},"170":{"name":"Colombia","code":"COL"},"174":{"name":"Central African Republic","code":"CAF"},"193":{"name":"Mayotte","code":"MYT"},"195":{"name":"Solomon Islands","code":"SLB"},"200":{"name":"Dominica","code":"DMA"},"202":{"name":"Fiji","code":"FJI"},"203":{"name":"French Polynesia","code":"PYF"},"205":{"name":"Greenland","code":"GRL"},"207":{"name":"Iceland","code":"ISL"},"208":{"name":"Kuwait","code":"KWT"},"210":{"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LUX"},"212":{"name":"Malta","code":"MLT"},"217":{"name":"Oman","code":"OMN"},"222":{"name":"Micronesia (country)","code":"FSM"},"226":{"name":"Qatar","code":"QAT"},"231":{"name":"San Marino","code":"SMR"},"238":{"name":"Venezuela","code":"VEN"},"245":{"name":"Reunion","code":"REU"},"246":{"name":"American Samoa","code":"ASM"},"252":{"name":"Guadeloupe","code":"GLP"},"254":{"name":"Guam","code":"GUM"},"256":{"name":"United States Virgin Islands","code":"VIR"},"258":{"name":"South Sudan","code":"SSD"},"284":{"name":"Martinique","code":"MTQ"}}}
