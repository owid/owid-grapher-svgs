all women and girls \nTarget: Ensure women's full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels \nof decision-making in political, economic and public life \nIndicator: 5.5.2: Proportion of women in managerial positions \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \nILO \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n \nDefinition: \nThis indicator refers to the proportion of females in the total number of persons employed in managerial \npositions. It is recommended to use two different measures jointly for this indicator: the share of females \nin (total) management and the share of females in senior and middle management (thus excluding junior \nmanagement). The joint calculation of these two measures provides information on whether women are \nmore represented in junior management than in senior and middle management, thus pointing to an \neventual ceiling for women to access higher-level management positions. In these cases, calculating only \nthe share of women in (total) management would be misleading, in that it would suggest that women \nhold positions with more decision-making power and responsibilities than they actually do. \n \nRationale: \nThe indicator provides information on the proportion of women who are employed in decision-making \nand management roles in government, large enterprises and institutions, thus providing some insight into \nwomen’s power in decision making and in the economy (especially compared to men's power in those \nareas). \n \nConcepts: \n\n- \n\n- \n\nEmployment comprises all persons of working age who, during a short reference period (one \nweek), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. \nEmployment in management is determined according to the categories of the latest version of \nthe International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-08), which organizes jobs into a \nclearly defined set of groups based on the tasks and duties undertaken in the job. For the \npurposes of this indicator, it is preferable to refer separately to senior and middle management \nonly on one hand, and to total management (including junior management) on the other. The \nshare of women tends to be higher in junior management than in senior and middle \nmanagement, so limiting the indicator to a measure including junior management may introduce \na bias. Senior and middle management correspond to sub-major groups 11, 12 and 13 in ISCO-08 \nand sub-major groups 11 and 12 in ISCO-88. If statistics are not available disaggregated at the \nsub-major group level (two-digit level of ISCO), then major group 1 of ISCO-88 and ISCO-08 can \nbe used as a proxy and the indicator would then refer only to total management (including junior \nmanagement). \n\n \n\n \n\n\fLast updated: March 2019 \n\n \nComments and limitations: \nThis indicator's main limitation is that it does not reflect differences in the levels of responsibility of \nwomen in these high- and middle-level positions or the importance of the enterprises and organizations \nin which they are employed. Its quality is also heavily dependent on the reliability of the employment \nstatistics by occupation at the two-digit level of the ISCO. \n \nMethodology \n\n \n\n \n\n \nComputation Method: \n-  Using ISCO-08: \n\n \nWhich can be also expressed as:  \n\n-  Using ISCO-08: \n\n \nWhich can also be expressed as: \n\nProportion of women in senior and middle management\n\n=  \n\n(Women employed in ISCO 08 category 1 −  Women employed in ISCO 08 category 14)\n(Persons employed in ISCO 08 category 1  −  Persons employed in ISCO 08 category 14)\n\n  × 100 \n\nProportion of women in senior and middle management\n\n=  \n\n(Women employed in ISCO 08 categories 11 +  12 + 13)\n(Persons employed in ISCO 08 categories 11 + 12 + 13)\n\n  × 100 \n\nProportion of women in management =  \n\nWomen employed in ISCO 08 category 1\nPersons employed in ISCO 08 category 1\n\n  × 100 \n\nProportion of women in senior and middle management:\n\n=  \n\n(Women employed in ISCO 88 category 1 –  Women employed in ISCO 88 category 13)\n(Persons employed in ISCO 88 category 1  −  Persons employed in ISCO 88 category 13)\n\n  × 100 \n\nProportion of women in senior and middle management:\n\n=  \n\n(Women employed in ISCO 88 categories 11 + 12)\n(Persons employed in ISCO 88 categories 11 + 12)\n\n  × 100 \n\nProportion of women in managerial positions: =  \n\nWomen employed in ISCO 88 category 1\nPersons employed in ISCO 88 category 1\n\n  × 100 \n\n \nDisaggregation: \nThis indicator requires no disaggregation per se, although employment statistics by both sex and \noccupation are needed to calculate it. \nIf statistics are available and the sample size permits, it may be of interest to cross-tabulate this indicator \nby economic activity (ISIC) or disaggregate further to observe the share of women across more detailed \noccupational groups. \nTreatment of missing values: \n \n\n•  At country level \n\nMultivariate regression and cross-validation techniques are used to impute missing values at the \ncountry level. The additional variables used for the imputation include a range of indicators, \nincluding labour market and economic data. However, the imputed missing country values are only \n\nAnd \n\n \n\nAnd \n\n \n\n\fLast updated: March 2019 \n\nused to calculate the global and regional estimates; they are not used for international reporting on \nthe SDG indicators by the ILO.  \nFor a more detailed methodological description, please refer to Trends Econometric Models: A \nReview of Methodology (ILO, Geneva, 2010), available at \nhttp://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/---emp_elm/---\ntrends/documents/publication/wcms_120382.pdf . \n \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\n \n\nRegional aggregates: \nThe aggregates are derived from the Trends Econometric Models (TEM) that are used to produce global \nand regional estimates of, amongst others, employment by occupation and gender. These models use \nmultivariate regression and cross-validation techniques to impute missing values at the country level, \nwhich are then aggregated to produce regional and global estimates. The regional and global proportions \nof women in managerial positions are obtained by first adding up, across countries, the numerator and \ndenominator of the formula that defines the proportion of women in managerial positions - outlined \nabove. Once both magnitudes are produced at the desired level of aggregation, the ratio between the \ntwo is used to compute the rate for each regional grouping and the global level. Notice that this direct \naggregation method can be used due to the imputation of missing observations. For further information \non the TEM, please refer to the technical background papers available at: \nhttp://www.ilo.org/empelm/projects/WCMS_114246/lang--en/index.htm. \n \n \nMethods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level: \nIn order to calculate this indicator, data on employment by sex and occupation is needed, using at least \nthe 2-digit level of the International Standard Classification of Occupations. This data is collected at the \nnational level mainly through labour force surveys (or other types of household surveys with an \nemployment module). For the methodology of each national household survey, one must refer to the \nmost comprehensive survey report or to the methodological publications of the national statistical office \nin question. \n\nILO Guidebook - Decent Work and the Sustainable Development Goals: A Guidebook on SDG \nLabour Market Indicators (https://www.ilo.org/stat/Publications/WCMS_647109/lang--\nen/index.htm ) \nILO Manual – Decent Work Indicators, Concepts and Definitions – Chapter 8, Equal opportunity \nand treatment in employment \nhttp://www.ilo.org/integration/resources/pubs/WCMS_229374/lang--en/index.htm  (second \nversion, page 146) \nResolution concerning statistics of work, employment and labour underutilization \n\nhttp://www.ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/resolutionsadopted-by-\ninternational-conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_230304/lang--en/index.htm  \n\nInternational Standard Classification of Occupations 2008 (ISCO-08) \n\nhttp://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/isco08/  \n\nILOSTAT Database (www.ilo.org/ilostat) \nILOSTAT Database – Metadata – Indicator Descriptions (Employment by occupation, at: \nhttp://www.ilo.org/ilostat-files/Documents/description_OCU_EN.pdf).  \n\n- \n\n- \n\n- \n\n- \n\n- \n- \n\n \nQuality assurance \n\n \n\n\fLast updated: March 2019 \n\nData consistency and quality checks regularly conducted for validation of the data before dissemination \nin the ILOSTAT database. In many cases, data are reported to the ILO Department of Statistics through its \nannual questionnaire on labour statistics, by national statistical offices or other relevant national \nagencies. Data are also received in other cases through agreements between the ILO Department of \nStatistics and regional or national statistical agencies, or obtained through ILO processing of microdata \nsets of national household surveys. The primary source of the data as well as the repository where \napplicable are indicated in the relevant metadata and/or footnotes in ILOSTAT and in the SDG Indicators \nGlobal Database. \n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \nThe recommended source for this indicator is a labour force survey or, if not available, other similar types \nof household surveys, including a module on employment. In the absence of any labour-related \nhousehold survey, establishment surveys or administrative records may be used to gather information on \nthe female share of employment by the required ISCO groups. In cases where establishment surveys or \nadministrative records are used, the coverage is likely to be limited to formal enterprises or enterprises of \na certain size. Information on the enterprises covered should be provided with the figures. When \ncomparing figures across years, any changes in the versions of ISCO that are used should be taken into \naccount. \n \nCollection process: \nThe ILO Department of Statistics sends out its annual questionnaire on labour statistics every year to all \nrelevant agencies within each country (national statistical office, labour ministry, etc.) requesting for the \nlatest annual data available and any revisions on numerous labour market topics and indicators, including \nmany SDG indicators. Indicator 5.5.2 is calculated from statistics submitted to the ILO Department of \nStatistics via this questionnaire as well as through special agreements with regional and national \nstatistical offices or through the processing of microdata sets of national household surveys. \n \nData Availability \n\n \nTime series: \nData for this indicator is available as of 2000 in the SDG Indicators Global Database, but time series going \nback several decades are available in ILOSTAT. \n \nCalendar \n\n \nData collection: \nThe ILO Department of Statistics sends out its annual questionnaire on labour statistics every year, \nusually in the 2nd quarter, with a view to receiving the requested statistics by the 3rd quarter or the end \nof the year at the latest. Data received in batch from regional and national statistical offices and data \nobtained through the processing of microdata sets of national household surveys by the ILO Department \nof Statistics are continuously updated in ILOSTAT (as they become available to the ILO Department of \nStatistics). \n\n \n\n\fLast updated: March 2019 \n\n \nData release: \nThe ILO Department of Statistics' online database ILOSTAT is continuously updated to reflect statistics \ncompiled and processed every week. In general, statistics for EUROSTAT and OECD countries are available \naround the 2nd or 3rd quarter of the year following the year of reference, whereas they are usually \navailable around the 3rd or 4th quarter of the year following the year of reference for the other \ncountries. \n \nData providers \n\nNational Statistical Offices \n \nData compilers \n\nILO \n \nReferences \n\n \nILOSTAT database: www.ilo.org/ilostat  \n\n- \n-  Decent Work and the Sustainable Development Goals: A Guidebook on SDG Labour Market \n\n- \n- \n\nIndicators: https://www.ilo.org/stat/Publications/WCMS_647109/lang--en/index.htm Decent \nwork indicators - ILO Manual: http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---\nintegration/documents/publication/wcms_229374.pdf  \nISCO-08: http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/isco08/  \nResolution concerning statistics of work, employment and labour underutilization, adopted by \nthe 19th ICLS: http://ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-\nguidelines/resolutions-adopted-byinternational-conferences-of-labour-\nstatisticians/WCMS_230304/lang--en/index.htm  \n \n\nRelated indicators \n\n8.5.1 Average hourly earnings of female and male employees, by occupation, age and persons with \ndisabilities \n \n\n \n\n\f"}}},"entityKey":{"1":{"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GBR"},"2":{"name":"Ireland","code":"IRL"},"3":{"name":"France","code":"FRA"},"4":{"name":"Belgium","code":"BEL"},"5":{"name":"Netherlands","code":"NLD"},"6":{"name":"Germany","code":"DEU"},"7":{"name":"Switzerland","code":"CHE"},"8":{"name":"Italy","code":"ITA"},"9":{"name":"Spain","code":"ESP"},"10":{"name":"Sweden","code":"SWE"},"11":{"name":"Poland","code":"POL"},"12":{"name":"Russia","code":"RUS"},"13":{"name":"United States","code":"USA"},"16":{"name":"Albania","code":"ALB"},"21":{"name":"Argentina","code":"ARG"},"24":{"name":"Austria","code":"AUT"},"28":{"name":"Bangladesh","code":"BGD"},"31":{"name":"Belize","code":"BLZ"},"34":{"name":"Bolivia","code":"BOL"},"35":{"name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","code":"BIH"},"36":{"name":"Botswana","code":"BWA"},"37":{"name":"Brazil","code":"BRA"},"38":{"name":"Brunei","code":"BRN"},"39":{"name":"Bulgaria","code":"BGR"},"42":{"name":"Cambodia","code":"KHM"},"63":{"name":"Uruguay","code":"URY"},"64":{"name":"Tanzania","code":"TZA"},"65":{"name":"Egypt","code":"EGY"},"66":{"name":"North Macedonia","code":"MKD"},"70":{"name":"Turkey","code":"TUR"},"71":{"name":"Tunisia","code":"TUN"},"72":{"name":"United Arab Emirates","code":"ARE"},"75":{"name":"Thailand","code":"THA"},"78":{"name":"Eswatini","code":"SWZ"},"81":{"name":"South Africa","code":"ZAF"},"83":{"name":"Slovenia","code":"SVN"},"84":{"name":"Vietnam","code":"VNM"},"85":{"name":"Slovakia","code":"SVK"},"88":{"name":"Serbia","code":"SRB"},"91":{"name":"Rwanda","code":"RWA"},"92":{"name":"Romania","code":"ROU"},"95":{"name":"Portugal","code":"PRT"},"96":{"name":"Philippines","code":"PHL"},"99":{"name":"Papua New Guinea","code":"PNG"},"100":{"name":"Panama","code":"PAN"},"101":{"name":"Pakistan","code":"PAK"},"102":{"name":"Norway","code":"NOR"},"103":{"name":"Nigeria","code":"NGA"},"105":{"name":"Nicaragua","code":"NIC"},"108":{"name":"Namibia","code":"NAM"},"109":{"name":"Mozambique","code":"MOZ"},"112":{"name":"Mongolia","code":"MNG"},"113":{"name":"Mexico","code":"MEX"},"118":{"name":"Madagascar","code":"MDG"},"119":{"name":"Lithuania","code":"LTU"},"121":{"name":"Liberia","code":"LBR"},"122":{"name":"Latvia","code":"LVA"},"125":{"name":"Laos","code":"LAO"},"136":{"name":"Indonesia","code":"IDN"},"137":{"name":"India","code":"IND"},"138":{"name":"Hungary","code":"HUN"},"139":{"name":"Honduras","code":"HND"},"140":{"name":"Palestine","code":"PSE"},"142":{"name":"Myanmar","code":"MMR"},"146":{"name":"Guyana","code":"GUY"},"148":{"name":"Guatemala","code":"GTM"},"149":{"name":"Greece","code":"GRC"},"150":{"name":"Ghana","code":"GHA"},"151":{"name":"Gambia","code":"GMB"},"155":{"name":"Finland","code":"FIN"},"156":{"name":"Estonia","code":"EST"},"158":{"name":"Ethiopia","code":"ETH"},"160":{"name":"Dominican Republic","code":"DOM"},"161":{"name":"Denmark","code":"DNK"},"162":{"name":"Czechia","code":"CZE"},"163":{"name":"Cyprus","code":"CYP"},"165":{"name":"Croatia","code":"HRV"},"167":{"name":"Democratic Republic of Congo","code":"COD"},"201":{"name":"Ecuador","code":"ECU"},"202":{"name":"Fiji","code":"FJI"},"207":{"name":"Iceland","code":"ISL"},"210":{"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LUX"},"211":{"name":"Maldives","code":"MDV"},"212":{"name":"Malta","code":"MLT"},"213":{"name":"Mauritius","code":"MUS"},"215":{"name":"Montenegro","code":"MNE"},"233":{"name":"Seychelles","code":"SYC"},"239":{"name":"Samoa","code":"WSM"},"259":{"name":"El Salvador","code":"SLV"}}}
