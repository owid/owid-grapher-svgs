      "descriptionSnapshot": "This dataset gives global estimates of plastic use, broken down by application type. The use of primary plastics is estimated from regional consumption data, assuming a consistent split by polymer type across different applications globally, as per Ryberg et al. (2019). Historical values (data from before 2015) are extrapolated using the evolution model in Geyer, Jambeck and Law (2017). The use of secondary plastics is calculated using recycling and recycling loss rates, as detailed in the GPO annex. These plastic use data are then related to economic flows in the OECD ENV-Linkages model to track changes over time. The total plastic use is the combined amount of primary and secondary plastic use.",

Secondary plastics use are derived using recycling rates and recycling loss rates, as described in the GPO annex.

The total plastics use is equal to the sum of primary and secondary plastics use.",
