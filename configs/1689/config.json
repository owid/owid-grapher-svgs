FLOPS are a measure of calculations per second for floating-point operations. Floating-point operations are needed for very large or very small real numbers, or computations that require a large dynamic range. It is therefore a more accurate measured than simply instructions per second.","originUrl":"","dimensions":[{"property":"y","variableId":65437}],"sourceDesc":"TOP500 Supercomputer Database","isPublished":true,"selectedData":[{"index":0,"entityId":355}],"internalNotes":""}
