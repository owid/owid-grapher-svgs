Some substances that deplete the ozone layer are 'stronger' than others, meaning one tonne will cause greater damage than one tonne of another. ODP tonnes are calculated by multiplying a substance's emissions in tonnes, by its 'ozone-depleting potential'.\n\nOzone-depleting potential measures how much depletion a substance causes relative to CFC-11, which has a value of 1.0. If one tonne of a gas caused twice the depletion of CFC-11, it would have a potential of 2.0.",
