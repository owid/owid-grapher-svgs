    "additionalInfo": "\nWellcome conducted the first Global Monitor – the largest-ever study of public attitudes to science and health – in 2018. The first wave covered topics such as whether people trust science, scientists and information about health, and attitudes towards the safety and efficacy of vaccines – a focus which has since proved incredibly forward-thinking.\n\nIn 2020, the Global Monitor's central focus was science's role in mental health.\n\nThe datasets and crosstabs cover the mental health sections of the WGM Survey 2020 conducted in 113 countries and territories worldwide on mental health views and experiences. The rest of the survey data will be published in subsequent data releases.\n\n\nRelevant links:\n\n• You can find the Wellcome Global Monitor 2020 full report at https://cms.wellcome.org/sites/default/files/2021-10/wellcome-global-monitor-mental-health.pdf\n• Details on the methodology: https://cms.wellcome.org/sites/default/files/2021-10/wgm2020-methodology.pdf\n• Details about the questionnaire: https://cms.wellcome.org/sites/default/files/2021-10/wgm2020-questionnaire.pdf\n• Full questionnaire: https://cms.wellcome.org/sites/default/files/2021-11/WGM_Full_Questionnaire.pdf\n\n\nNote 1: Data for answers where the demographic group had less than 100 participants are filtered out.\n\nNote 2: Empty answers have been filtered out. Empty answers may appear because the question was not applicable to the respondent or the respondent did not answer the question."
