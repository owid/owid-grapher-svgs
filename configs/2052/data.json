sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment \nand decent work for all \nTarget: Achieve higher levels of economic productivity through diversification, technological upgrading \nand innovation, including through a focus on high-value added and labour-intensive sectors \nIndicator: 8.2.1: Annual growth rate of real GDP per employed person \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \nILO \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n \nDefinition: \nAnnual growth rate of real GDP per employed person conveys the annual percentage change in real Gross \nDomestic Product per employed person. \n \nRationale: \nThe real GDP per employed person being a measure of labour productivity, this indicator represents a \nmeasure of labour productivity growth, thus providing information on the evolution, efficiency and \nquality of human capital in the production process. \n \nEconomic growth in a country can be ascribed either to increased employment or to more effective work \nby those who are employed. This indicator casts light on the latter effect, being therefore a key measure \nof economic performance. Labour productivity (and growth) estimates can support the formulation of \nlabour market policies and monitor their effects. They can also contribute to the understanding of how \nlabour market performance affects living standards. \n \nConcepts: \nGross Domestic Product (GDP): It is the main measure of national output, representing the total value of \nall final goods and services within the System of National Accounts (SNA) production boundary produced \nin a particular economy (that is, the dollar value of all goods and services within the SNA production \nboundary produced within a country’s borders in a given year). According to the SNA, “GDP is the sum of \ngross value added of all resident producer units plus that part (possibly the total) of taxes on products, \nless subsidies on products, that is not included in the valuation of output … GDP is also equal to the sum \nof the final uses of goods and services (all uses except intermediate consumption) measured at \npurchasers’ prices, less the value of imports of goods and services GDP is also equal to the sum of primary \nincomes distributed by resident producer units.” \n \nReal Gross Domestic Product (GDP): Real GDP refers to GDP calculated at constant prices, that is, the \nvolume level of GDP, excluding the effect of inflation and favouring comparisons of quantities beyond \nprice changes. Constant price estimates of GDP are calculated by expressing values in terms of a base \nperiod. In theory, the price and quantity components of a value are identified and the price in the base \nperiod is substituted for that in the current period. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: March 2019 \n\nEmployed persons: Persons of working age (usually defined as persons aged 15 and above) who, during a \nshort reference period such as a week, performed work for others in exchange for pay or profit (as stated \nin the Resolution concerning statistics of work, employment and labour underutilization adopted by the \n19th International Conference of Labour Statisticians). \n \nComments and limitations: \nOutput measures are obtained from national accounts and represent, as much as possible, GDP at market \nprices for the aggregate economy. However, despite common principles that are mostly based on the \nUnited Nations System of National Accounts, there are still significant problems in international \nconsistency of national accounts estimates, based on factors such as differences in the treatment of \noutput in services sectors, differences in methods used to correct output measures for price changes (in \nparticular, the use of different weighting systems to obtain deflators) and differences in the degree of \ncoverage of informal economic activities. \n \nData on employment used in the denominator of this indicator refer, as much as possible, to the average \nnumber of persons with one or more paid jobs during the year. That is, the reliability of the employment \ndata is also dependent on the degree of coverage of informal activities by the statistical source used. \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \n\nReal GDP per employed person =  \n\nGDP at constant prices \n \n\nTotal employment\n\n \nThe numerator and denominator of the equation above should refer to the same reference period, for \nexample, the same calendar year. \n \nIf we call the real GDP per employed person “LabProd”, then the annual growth rate of real GDP per \nemployed person is calculated as follows: \n\nAnnual growth rate of real GDP per employed person =  \n\n(LabProd in year n) – (LabProd in year n − 1)\n\n(LabProd in year n − 1)\n\n  × 100 \n\n \nDisaggregation: \nNo disaggregation required for this indicator. \n \nTreatment of missing values: \n \n\n•  At country level \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n \n\n \n\n \n\nMultivariate regression techniques are used to impute missing employment values at the country \nlevel. \nFor a detailed description of the methodology used, please refer to Trends Econometric Models: A \nReview of Methodology (ILO, Geneva, 2010), available at \nhttp://www.ilo.org/empelm/pubs/WCMS_120382/lang--en/index.htm. \n \n\n\fLast updated: March 2019 \n\nRegional aggregates: \nTo address the problem of missing data, the ILO designed several econometric models which are used to \nproduce estimates of labour market indicators in the countries and years for which real data are not \navailable. The employment data derived from the Trends Econometric Models (TEM) are used to produce \nestimates on labour productivity. These models use multivariate regression techniques to impute missing \nvalues at the country level, which are then aggregated to produce regional and global estimates.

In the absence of a household survey, establishment surveys, \n\n \n\n \n\n\fLast updated: March 2019 \n\nadministrative records or official estimates based on reliable sources can be used as well as population \ncensuses. It is however important to note that employment data from establishment surveys will capture \nthe number of jobs and not the number of persons employed as preferred for the denominator. Also, \nestablishment surveys cover, in many cases, the formal sector and employers and employees only, not \naccounting for the whole economy. \n \nWhen calculating this indicator, it is important to ensure that the coverage of the employment data is \nconsistent with that of the national accounts. \n \nCollection process: \nFor the purposes of international reporting on the SDG indicators, the ILO uses country-level estimates of \nGDP in constant 2010 US$ from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators database and country-\nlevel estimates on employment from household surveys or derived from the ILO’s TEM to calculate levels \nand growth rates of labour productivity at the country, regional and global levels. \n \nData Availability \n\n \nDescription: \n  \n \nTime series: \nData for this indicator is available as of 2000 in the SDG Indicators Global Database, but time series going \nback to 1991 and including projections up to 2022 are available in ILOSTAT. \n \nCalendar \n\n \nData collection: \n \n \nData release: \nILO estimates of labour productivity are part of the ILO Estimates and Projections series, analysed in the \nILO's World Employment and Social Outlook reports.
