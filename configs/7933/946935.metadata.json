  "descriptionShort": "Generative AI refers to AI systems that can create new content, such as images, text, or music, based on patterns learned from existing data.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- Reporting a time series of AI investments in nominal prices (i.e., without adjusting for inflation) means it makes little sense to compare observations across time; it is therefore not very useful. To make comparisons across time possible, one has to take into account that prices change (e.g., there is inflation).\n- It is not obvious how to adjust this time series for inflation, and we debated it at some length within our team.\n- It would be straightforward to adjust the time series for price changes if we knew the prices of the specific goods and services that these investments purchased. This would make it possible to calculate a volume measure of AI investments, and it would tell us how much these investments bought. But such a metric is not available. While a comprehensive price index is not available, we know that the cost for some crucial AI technology has fallen rapidly in price.\n- In the absence of a comprehensive price index that captures the price of AI-specific goods and services, one has to rely on one of the available metrics for the price of a bundle of goods and services. In the end we decided to use the US Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n- The US CPI does not provide us with a volume measure of AI goods and services, but it does capture the opportunity costs of these investments. The inflation adjustment of this time series of AI investments therefore lets us understand the size of these investments relative to whatever else these sums of money could have purchased.",

    "It is highly likely that these investments are partly allocated towards the necessary infrastructure, computational power, and support services required to develop, deploy, and operationalize AI applications. For investments in new data centers, these facilities often have broader purposes beyond just AI, and detailed data on this specific allocation is not available.",

Employing natural language processing quid sifts through vast unstructured datasets—including news aggregations, blogs, company records, and patent databases—to detect patterns and insights. Additionally, Quid is constantly expanding its database to include more companies, sometimes resulting in higher reported investment volumes for specific years.",
