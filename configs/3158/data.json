(2018) compared the leading causes of death in the United States as their share of total deaths relative to Google searches and media coverage in The New York Times (NYT) and The Guardian newspaper. For this analysis they selected the top 10 causes of death in the USA in addition to terrorism, homicide, and drug overdoses (which they assumed to also receive significant media attention).\n\nData each causes' share of total deaths in the USA was assessed based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) WONDER database for public health, available at: https://wonder.cdc.gov/. This is available from 1999 to 2016. Combined, the 13 causes of death assessed in this analysis account for approximately 88% of all deaths in the USA.\n\nData on Google searches was derived from Google Trends (available from 2004 to 2016). This was assessed on the number of searches for these terms and close synonyms.\n\nThe New York Times and The Guardian media coverage was assessed from both newspapers' article databases. Here the authors searched the database for a list of all articles which contained the word anywhere (headline or body).\n\nAll values are normalized to 100% so they represent their relative share of the top causes, rather than absolute \ncounts (e.g. ‘deaths’ represents each causes’ share of deaths within the 13 categories shown rather than total deaths). This allows for us to compare the relative representation of different sources.\n\nFull methodology, notes and open-access data on GitHub are available from the original source: https://owenshen24.github.io/charting-death/."}}},"entityKey":{"37526":{"name":"Alzheimer's Disease","code":null},"37527":{"name":"Cancer","code":null},"37529":{"name":"Diabetes","code":null},"37530":{"name":"Heart disease","code":null},"37531":{"name":"Homicide","code":null},"37532":{"name":"Kidney disease","code":null},"37533":{"name":"Lower respiratory disease","code":null},"37534":{"name":"Drug overdose","code":null},"37535":{"name":"Pneumonia & influenza","code":null},"37536":{"name":"Stroke","code":null},"37537":{"name":"Suicide","code":null},"37538":{"name":"Terrorism","code":null},"71728":{"name":"Accidents","code":null}}}
