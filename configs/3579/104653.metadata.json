C., Clapham, P. J., & Ivashchenko, Y. V. (2014). Emptying the oceans: a summary of industrial whaling catches in the 20th century. Marine Fisheries Review, 76(4), 37-48.\n\nThe above paper draws on data originally published by the International Whaling Commission (IWC).\n\nData from 2000 onwards is sourced directly from the International Whaling Commissions (IWC) which recorded the number of catches at: https://web.archive.org/web/20220613153315/https://iwc.int/public/downloads/8sXJb/Total_catches_since_1986.pdf\n\nFor the bowhead whale we source directly from the IWC from 1989 onwards."
