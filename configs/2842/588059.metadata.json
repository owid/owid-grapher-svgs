    "additionalInfo": "Production: Crops and livestock products\n\nOriginal dataset description by FAOSTAT:\nCrop and livestock statistics are recorded for 278 products, covering the following categories: 1) CROPS PRIMARY: Cereals, Citrus Fruit, Fibre Crops, Fruit, Oil Crops, Oil Crops and Cakes in Oil Equivalent, Pulses, Roots and Tubers, Sugar Crops, Treenuts and Vegetables. Data are expressed in terms of area harvested, production quantity and yield. Cereals: Area and production data on cereals relate to crops harvested for dry grain only. Cereal crops harvested for hay or harvested green for food, feed or silage or used for grazing are therefore excluded. 2) CROPS PROCESSED: Beer of barley; Cotton lint; Cottonseed; Margarine, short; Molasses; Oil, coconut (copra); Oil, cottonseed; Oil, groundnut; Oil, linseed; Oil, maize; Oil, olive, virgin; Oil, palm; Oil, palm kernel; Oil, rapeseed; Oil, safflower; Oil, sesame; Oil, soybean; Oil, sunflower; Palm kernels; Sugar Raw Centrifugal; Wine. 3) LIVE ANIMALS: Animals live n.e.s.; Asses; Beehives; Buffaloes; Camelids, other; Camels; Cattle; Chickens; Ducks; Geese and guinea fowls; Goats; Horses; Mules; Pigeons, other birds; Pigs; Rabbits and hares; Rodents, other; Sheep; Turkeys. 4) LIVESTOCK PRIMARY: Beeswax; Eggs (various types);  Hides buffalo, fresh; Hides, cattle, fresh; Honey, natural; Meat (ass, bird nes, buffalo, camel, cattle, chicken, duck,  game, goat, goose and guinea fowl, horse, mule, Meat nes, meat other camelids, Meat other rodents, pig, rabbit, sheep, turkey); Milk (buffalo, camel, cow, goat, sheep); Offals, nes; Silk-worm cocoons, reelable; Skins (goat, sheep); Snails, not sea; Wool, greasy. 5) LIVESTOCK PROCESSED: Butter (of milk from sheep, goat, buffalo, cow); Cheese (of milk from goat, buffalo, sheep, cow milk); Cheese of skimmed cow milk; Cream fresh; Ghee (cow and buffalo milk); Lard; Milk (dry buttermilk,  skimmed condensed, skimmed cow, skimmed dried, skimmed evaporated, whole condensed, whole dried, whole evaporated); Silk raw; Tallow; Whey (condensed and dry); Yoghurt\n\nProcessing of possible data anomalies by Our World in Data:\n\n+The area harvested of spinach for China (which refers to mainland) in 1984 is missing. This causes that other regions that are aggregates which include China mainland have a spurious reduction in area harvested of spinach in that year, and a spurious increase in yield. Therefore, we remove those spurious aggregate values.\n\n+The amount of eggs produced per bird for Northern Europe (FAO) is unreasonably high before 1973, with values between 50kg and 115kg, while from 1973 on it has more reasonable values, below 20kg. Therefore, we remove all values for Northern Europe (FAO) between 1961 and 1972.\n\n+Tea production in FAO data increased dramatically from 1990 to 1991 for many different countries (including some of the main producers, like China and India). However, data from 1991 was flagged as 'Estimated value' (while data prior to 1991 is flagged as 'Official figure'). This potentially anomalous increase was not present in the previous version of the data. Therefore, we removed tea production data (as well as per-capita production and yield) from 1991 onwards.\n\nFAO does not provide data for the total number of slaughtered animals to produce meat. We calculate this metric by adding up the number of slaughtered animals of all meat groups. However, when data for slaughtered poultry (which usually outnumbers other meat groups) is not provided, we do not calculate the total (to avoid spurious dips in the data)."
