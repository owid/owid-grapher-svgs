        "additionalInfo": " \n\nLast updated: 16 January 2017 \n\n \n \nGoal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice \nfor all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels \nTarget 16.10: Ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance with \nnational legislation and international agreements \nIndicator 16.10.2:  Number of countries that adopt and implement constitutional, statutory and/or \npolicy guarantees for public access to information \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \n \nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n \nDefinition: \n \nNumber of countries that adopt and implement constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for \npublic access to information \n \nThe focus of this indicator is thus on the status of adoption and implementation of constitutional, \nstatutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information. The definition relates directly to \n“public access to information”, which is wider than, but is also very much based upon, the established \nfundamental freedoms of expression and association. Conversely, these freedoms also both impact on \nthe environment for public access to information.  \n \nRationale: \n \nAs suggested by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and UNESCO in earlier \npresentations to the UN Technical Support Team (UN TST), this is a relevant and measurable indicator.  \n \nIt also responds to the growing number of UN member states that have already adopted legal \nguarantees, and many others that are currently considering relevant legislation or regulation in the field. \n \nThe rationale for assessing the implementation dimension is to assess the relevance of legal steps to \npractical information accessibility. It is not a composite indicator, but a logical linkage of laws and policies \nto practical impact that is relevant to SDG concerns. \n \nFor this indicator, the operative words are “adoption” and “implementation”. As such, it establishes: (a) \nwhether a country (or at the global level, the number of countries) has constitutional, statutory and/or \npolicy guarantees for public access to information; (b) the extent to which such national guarantees \nreflect ‘international agreements’ (e.g. Universal Declaration of Human Rights, etc.); and (c) the \nimplementation mechanisms in place for such guarantees, including the following variables: \n- Government efforts to publicly promote the right to information. \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 16 January 2017 \n\n \n \n- Citizens’ awareness of their legal right to information and their ability to utilize it effectively. \n- The capacity of public bodies to provide information upon request by the public.  \n \nThis indicator thus collates data from multiple sources, including National Human Rights Institutions, \nnational and international non-governmental organizations, academic institutions, and national media \nregulatory authorities, among others. Such information will be gathered, processed and checked by \ninternational organizations - UNESCO and World Bank. \n \nUNESCO collects some aspects of this data using the Media Development Indicators, in addition to the \nbiennial World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development report.  \n \nData on the existence of freedom of information laws are available for at least 195 countries. \n \nConcepts: \n \nConceptually, ‘public access to information’ refers to “the presence of a robust system through which \ninformation is made available to citizens and others.” Such a system represents a combination of \nintellectual, physical, and social elements that affect the availability of information to individuals. In other \nwords, in discussing the issue of public access to information, it is important to recognize that any \nmeasurement of its practical outworking needs to take into account how individuals perceive the quality \nof information in the public domain, the nature of the communicative infrastructure in place to facilitate \naccess, and how that information is ultimately utilized by individuals as members of a particular polity.  \n \nIn general, then, these are the issues that go into legislation and policy on public access. More \nspecifically, such legislation and policy take the form of Freedom of Information laws (FOI laws) which are \naimed at allowing access by the general public to data held by national governments and, increasingly, by \nprivate companies whose work intersect with government operations.  \n \nThe emergence of freedom of information legislation was a response to increasing dissatisfaction with \nthe secrecy surrounding government policy development and decision making. They establish a \"right-to-\nknow\" legal process by which requests may be made for government-held information, to be received \nfreely or at minimal cost, barring standard exceptions. \n \nSuch a formulation has a basis in international agreements. For example, the right to freedom of \nexpression, which is not only recognized as a basic human right in the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights (1948), is also upheld in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966), the \nEuropean Convention on Human Rights (1950), the American Convention on Human Rights (1969) and \nthe African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights (1981), thus lending itself to universal political \nrecognition and application. More specifically, in the European context, reference may be made to the \nCouncil of Europe Convention on Access to Official Documents, adopted on 18 June 2009. In the \nAmericas, the Organization of American States’ Inter-American Juridical Committee developed a set of \nPrinciples on the Right of Access to Information in 2008. \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nThis indicator does not assess the totality of “public access to information” component of the full Target \nof 16.10. Nevertheless, it focusses on a key determinant of the wider information environment. \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 16 January 2017 \n\n \n \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \n \nThe method of computation is both quantitative and qualitative, with data generated from a global \nreview of existing surveys (e.g. UNESCO's World Trends in Freedom of Expression & Media Development \nreports, etc.), administrative records, expert assessments (e.g. World Justice Open Government Index), \netc. More specifically, the following key variables will be assessed:  \n \n1. Does a country have constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to \ninformation? \n2. Do those constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees reflect known international agreements \n(e.g. the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, \netc.)? \n3. What implementation mechanisms are in place to ensure that such guarantees work optimally? \n \nTo address these questions, the following will serve as performance sub-indicators: \n- National law or constitutional guarantee on the right to information \n- Country has signed and ratified relevant treaty obligations, with no significant exemptions, and these \nare reflected, to the extent possible, in domestic FOI legislation \n- Public is aware of and exercises right to access official information \n- Public bodies release information both pro-actively and on demand \n- Effective and efficient appeals mechanism via independent administrative body e.g. information \ncommissioner or ombudsman \n- Any restriction on grounds of protection of personal privacy is narrowly defined so as to exclude \ninformation in which there is no justifiable public interest.  \n \nThe means of verification will include: \n- Any law or policy on right to information that accords with international standards \n- Reports from credible agencies/experts about right to information guarantees and the extent to which \nthey reflect international standards/agreements \n- Policies of public bodies concerning release of information (which ensure readily, freely available public \naccess to information, including online) \n- Evidence of state commitment to open government e.g. publication and dissemination of laws, court \ndecisions, parliamentary proceedings, spending programmes (vis-à-vis SDG undertakings) \n- Statistical information about public requests for official information and their fulfilment or rejection \n- Statistical information about appeals or complaints over information requests that have been refused \n \nDisaggregation: \n \nThe indicator can be disaggregated in terms of the extent to which the residence of citizens affects their \nability to access information (e.g. how do rural, peri-rural, urban and peri-urban dwellers access \ninformation from public bodies). It can also be disaggregated in terms of whether gender influences \nability to access information. Furthermore, aspects of how disability affects public access to information \ncan also be assessed. \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 16 January 2017 \n\n \n \n \nTreatment of missing values: \n \n\n•  At country level \n\n \nAn expert assessment of state-of-the-art literature on FOI laws establishes: \n(I) the number of countries currently with FOI laws/policies; \n(2) the extent to which they reflect 'international agreements'; and \n(3) the effectiveness of the implementation mechanisms \n \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\n \nAn expert assessment of state-of-the-art literature on FOI laws, along with in-country data from \nUNESCO ACIs (Advisors for Communication and Information) in the field, establishes: \n(I) the number of countries currently with FOI laws/policies; \n(2) the extent to which they reflect 'international agreements'; and \n(3) the effectiveness of the implementation mechanisms \n\n \nRegional aggregates: \n \nAn expert assessment of state-of-the-art literature on FOI laws, along with in-country data from UNESCO \nACIs (Advisors for Communication and Information) in the field, establishes: \n(I) the total number of countries currently with FOI laws/policies; \n(2) the extent to which these laws/policies reflect 'international agreements'; and \n(3) the effectiveness of the implementation mechanisms in place (This aspect is measured in terms of \nsurveys undertaken by different international organizations active in this field) \n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \n \nUNESCO and World Bank reports \nOther UN bodies, such as UNDP \nNational bodies such as commissioners responsible for right to information implementation \nMedia regulators  \nAcademic and research institutions  \nMedia support NGOs (national and international) \n \nMethods used for data collection for this data are varied, drawing upon both quantitative and qualitative \nones, including: \n\n•  Qualitative expert assessments (World Justice Open Government Index, launched in 2015 and \n\ncovering 102 countries);  \n\n•  Administrative records (e.g. number of requests for information; number of requests process in \n\n• \n\nthe last 12 months; number of women who submit such requests, etc.)  \nSurveys (e.g. UNESCO World Trends in Freedom of Expression & Media Development and Media \nDevelopment Indicators (MDI) reports; Open Society Foundation’s series of surveys on ‘access to \ninformation laws and practices’; the World Values Survey [www.worldvaluessurvey.org]; IPU \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 16 January 2017 \n\n \n \n\ndata on access-to-information legislation and constitutional guarantees of access to information; \nWorld Values Survey on trust of news media]; etc.) \n\n \nUN or relevant regional bodies that carry details of each treaty, including countries that have signed, \nratified or registered any exemptions to their obligations, together with the treaty bodies’ general \ncomments on implementation. \n \nVarious international and regional rapporteurs on freedom of expression issue country-specific reports. \n \nFor data on national laws and constitutional guarantees, sources include: national libraries, law \ncommissions, official records of parliament and government records. \n \nList: \n \nUNESCO and World Bank reports; Other UN bodies; National bodies; World Justice Open Government \nIndex, Administrative records, World Justice Open Government Index, UNESCO World Trends in Freedom \nof Expression & Media Development and Media Development Indicators (MDI) reports; Open Society \nFoundation’s, World Values Survey [www.worldvaluessurvey.org]; IPU data on access-to-information \nlegislation and constitutional guarantees of access to information; World Values Survey on trust of news \nmedia]; etc.) \n \nCollection process: \n \nUNESCO uses a triangulated method to compare data for global monitoring, which includes (I) databases \nmaintained by other international agencies; (2) own international surveys carried out in countries by \nindependent entities and (3) modelled and estimated data, based on other data sources. More \nspecifically, UNESCO analyses data inputs from a variety of sources to produce a consensus list of \ncountries with freedom of information laws or equivalent. Among those organizations and experts that \nmake available their data are: Freedominfo.org, Fringe Special by Robert Vleugels, Open Society Justice \nInitiative, Right to Information Rating, by Access Info Europe and the Centre for Law and Democracy, \nARTICLE 19. Others include international agencies and UN bodies, such as: The World Bank, The Office of \nthe High Commissioner for Human Rights, The UN Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of \nthe Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression. \n \nData Availability \n\n \nDescription: \n \nData on the existence of freedom of information laws are available for at least 195 countries. However, \nfor future data collection and analysis, efforts are underway to ensure that the data is analyzed to yield \ninformation on aspects relating to how FOI laws are actually \"implemented\", rather than just their \nexistence. \n \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 16 January 2017 \n\n \n \nCalendar \n\n \nData collection: \n \nFrom Jan-17 to Jul-17 \n \nData release: \n \n1-Oct-2017 \n \nData providers \n\n \nName: \n \nUNESCO, World Bank, UNDP, and other UN bodies; National bodies, Academic and research institutions, \nMedia support NGOs \n \nDescription: \n \nUNESCO, represented by National Programme Officers and regional Advisors for Communication and \nInformation in the field offices; Other UN bodies, such as World Bank, UNDP, etc.; National bodies such as \ncommissioners responsible for right to information implementation; Media regulators; Academic and \nresearch institutions; Media support NGOs (national and international) \n \nData compilers \n\n \nUNESCO \n \nReferences \n\nURL: \n \nhttp://en.unesco.org/ \n \nReferences: \n \n1.
