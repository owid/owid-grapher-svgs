Water footprints are measured over their full supply chain (for example, water requirements for livestock products includes that from animal feed). \n\nThey include blue, green and grey water components, which the Water Footprint Network define as:\n- Blue Water: \"Volume of surface and groundwater consumed as a result of the production of a good or service. Consumption refers to the volume of freshwater used and then evaporated or incorporated into a product. It also includes water abstracted from surface or groundwater in a catchment and returned to another catchment or the sea. It is the amount of water abstracted from groundwater or surface water that does not return to the catchment from which it was withdrawn.\"\n\n- Green Water: \"The precipitation on land that does not run off or recharge the groundwater but is stored in the soil or temporarily stays on top of the soil or vegetation. Eventually, this part of precipitation evaporates or transpires through plants. Green water can be made productive for crop growth (although not all green water can be taken up by crops, because there will always be evaporation from the soil and because not all periods of the year or areas are suitable for crop growth).\"\n\n- Grey Water: \"The grey water footprint of a product is an indicator of freshwater pollution that can be associated with the production of a product over its full supply chain. It is defined as the volume of freshwater that is required to assimilate the load of pollutants based on natural background concentrations and existing ambient water quality standards. It is calculated as the volume of water that is required to dilute pollutants to such an extent that the quality of the water remains above agreed water quality standards.\"\n\n\n"}}},"entityKey":{"34653":{"name":"Milk","code":null},"34790":{"name":"Cereals","code":null},"34795":{"name":"Pulses","code":null},"34798":{"name":"Vegetables","code":null},"34801":{"name":"Eggs","code":null},"34841":{"name":"Beef","code":null},"35908":{"name":"Nuts","code":null},"36001":{"name":"Butter","code":null},"36365":{"name":"Sugar crops","code":null},"36366":{"name":"Starchy roots","code":null},"36367":{"name":"Fruits","code":null},"36368":{"name":"Oil crops","code":null},"36369":{"name":"Chicken meat","code":null},"36370":{"name":"Pigmeat","code":null},"36371":{"name":"Sheep/goat meat","code":null}}}
