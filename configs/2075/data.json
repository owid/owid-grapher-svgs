These indicators \n\nwill eventually reflect the agreements on the Sendai Framework indicators. \n\nThe disaster loss data is significantly influenced by large-scale catastrophic events, which represent \n\nimportant outliers. UNISDR recommends Countries to report the data by event, so complementary \n\nanalysis can be done by both including and excluding such catastrophic events that can represent \n\nimportant outliers. \n\nComments and limitations: \n\nNot every country has a comparable national disaster loss database that is consistent with these \n\nguidelines (although current coverage exceeds 89 countries).

The converted global value is divided by global GDP (inflation adjusted, constant USD) \n\ncalculated from the World Bank Development Indicators. \n\nBy country, by event, by hazard type (e.g. disaggregation by climatological, hydrological, meteorological, \n\ngeophysical, biological and extra-terrestrial for natural hazards is possible following IRDR classification) \n\nMethodology \n\nComputation Method: \n\n%20on%20Indicators.pdf \n\nA short summary: \n\nDisaggregation: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBy asset loss category (health/education/road etc.) \n\nBy transportation mode (for 11.5.2) \n\nBy service sector (for 11.5.2) \n\nTreatment of missing values: \n\n•  At country level \n\n \n\nIn National Disaster Loss database data missing values and 0 or null are considered equivalent. This \n\nis a consequence of the typical form of disaster situation reports, which account only for those \n\nimpacts that occurred. Normally impacts that not occur are simply not reported (i.e. there are no \n\nexplicit reports that something didn't happen, for example if no agricultural damage occurs in a \n\n\fdisaster, the associated report simply does not have a section on agriculture, instead of a section \n\nLast updated: 07 July 2017 \n\nstating no impact occurred). \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNA \n\nRegional aggregates: \n\nSee under Computation Method. \n\nGDP. \n\nSources of discrepancies: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIt will be calculated as the summation of Direct Economic Loss per country divided by the total global \n\nThreshold (e.g. including/excluding small/large scale disasters): International Data Sources record only \n\nevents that surpass some threshold of impact. For example, EMDAT records only events with mortality \n\ngreater than 10, affected greater than 100 or an international declaration. Private Insurance or \n\nReinsurance global disaster databases record only events that have insured losses, which affects \n\nnegatively countries with low insurance market penetration.  \n\nMethodology / definition: International data sources use secondary data sources to assemble their \n\ndatasets. These data sources usually have non uniform or even inconsistent methodologies, producing \n\nheterogeneous datasets.  \n\nObservation (national level data is more comprehensive): International data collectors, due to limitations \n\non access to information, do not record a large number of events that are not publicised internationally, \n\nor are never 'seen' by the secondary data sources used. \n\n \nData Sources \n\nDescription: \n\nCollection process: \n\nNational disaster loss database, reported to UNISDR \n\nThe official counterpart(s) at the country level will build/adjust national disaster loss databases according \n\nto the recommendations and guidelines by the OEIWG. \n\n\fLast updated: 07 July 2017 \n\nThe number of countries with national disaster loss databases using the DesInventar tools and \n\nmethodology currently stands at 89 countries.
