'35 Years of Microprocessor Trend Data'.\n\nThis data also correlates to that published in 'The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology' by Ray Kurzweil up to 2003. Available at: http://www.singularity.com/index.html\n\nWhere data of several microprocessors is given for a single year, we have shown the highest transistor count per chip of that year.\n\nData for 2015 and 2017 have been updated by OurWorldinData based on highest transistor count noted at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count. The 2015 record was set by Oracle's 32-core SPARC M7 (https://www.enterprisetech.com/2014/08/13/oracle-cranks-cores-32-sparc-m7-chip/) and in 2017 by the 32-core AMD Epyc microprocessor."}}},"entityKey":{"355":{"name":"World","code":"OWID_WRL"}}}
