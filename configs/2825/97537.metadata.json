  "description": "Average hours a week that are devoted to school. Author's note that since school enrolment rates (used in constructing these estimates) were almost identical across genders, they do not distinguish by gender for those aged 14-17. However, because college enrolment rates differ across genders, the distinction is made for the 18-24 age group.  Total refers to male and female individuals for each respective age group.\n\nNote these estimates are averaged over the entire year, so they are lower than the amount of time a student would spend during the school year.",
