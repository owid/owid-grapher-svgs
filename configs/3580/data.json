(2010), and originally sourced from Christensen (2006). See full references below.\n\nThe dates of pre-whaling differs depending on the whale species and oceanic region. This ranges from as far back as 1530 for Right whales. The most common 'pre-whaling' date in the original source was in the late 19th and early 20th century. Here we have coded all pre-whaling dates as 1890 for consistency, but it should be noted that this date varies by species. The latest date – 2001 – is consistent across species.\n\nAll estimates are of the global total."}}},"entityKey":{"86068":{"name":"Blue whale","code":null},"86069":{"name":"Fin whale","code":null},"86070":{"name":"Humpack whale","code":null},"86071":{"name":"Sei/Bryde's whale","code":null},"86072":{"name":"Minke whale","code":null},"86073":{"name":"Gray whale","code":null},"86074":{"name":"Right whale","code":null},"86075":{"name":"Bowhead whale","code":null},"86076":{"name":"All whale species","code":null}}}
