See full references below.\n\nThe dates of pre-whaling differs depending on the whale species and oceanic region. This ranges from as far back as 1530 for Right whales. The most common 'pre-whaling' date in the original source was in the late 19th and early 20th century. Here we have coded all pre-whaling dates as 1890 for consistency, but it should be noted that this date varies by species. The latest date – 2001 – is consistent across species.\n\nAll estimates are of the global total."
