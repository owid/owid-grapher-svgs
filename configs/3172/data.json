This includes 15 countries from the Americas, 25 from Europe, 22 from Asia and the Pacific, and 14 African countries - 11 of which are Sub-Saharan. In total, this covers 90% of both the world population and total income. \n\nThe median sample size was 1,000 participants per country. The sample includes preference measures for over 80,000 participants altogether. \n\nCountry level averages for each economic preference were calculated using individual-level data weighted by the sampling weights provided by the Gallup World Poll. Each preference is normalized to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 in the individual-level data.\n\nFor more information on the construction of the GPS dataset, see Section II.A of the paper by Falk et al.
