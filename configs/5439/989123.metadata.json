Deaths involving the coronavirus (COVID-19) are defined as those with an underlying cause, or any mention of, ICD-10 codes U07.1 (COVID-19 virus identified) or U07.2 (COVID-19, virus not identified). The source notes that this differs from the definition used in the majority of mortality outputs.\n\nFigures are based on provisional mortality data and the Public Health Data Asset (PHDA), a linked dataset of people resident in England who could be linked to the 2011 Census and GP Patient Register. Therefore, the number of deaths and related population differ from other ONS mortality publication.\n\nRates marked as unreliable due to small numbers of deaths have been removed.",
