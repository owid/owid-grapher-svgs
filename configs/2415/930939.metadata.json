  "descriptionFromProducer": "**Long definition from World Bank:** Men who own land alone (% of men) is the percentage of men who solely own a land which is legally registered with their name or cannot be sold without their signature.\n\n**Source from World Bank:** Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)\n\n**Statistical concept and methodology from World Bank:** Men who own land alone is the number of men who say the only type of land they own is the one they own alone or don't share ownership with anyone, expressed as percentage of men who have been interviewed and It’s derived by dividing the number of men who responded they alone own a land, which legally registered with their name or can’t be sold without their signature, by total number of men who have been interviewed. ‘Ownership’ implies that the land is legally registered in the man's name or, since official property records do not always exist or are not maintained, the land is recognized as his  and cannot be sold without his signature or equivalent. ‘land’ includes all agricultural or non-agricultural land. Non-agricultural land refers to rural land that is not used for growing crops, and most land in urban areas.\n\n**License type from World Bank:** CC BY-4.0\n\n**Development relevance from World Bank:** Ownership of assets, particularly high-value assets, has many beneficial effects for households, including protection against financial ruin. For women in particular, asset ownership is a source of economic empowerment and provides protection in the case of marital dissolution or abandonment. There is increasing evidence that ownership of property by women has positive consequences for women’s empowerment, nutritional and health outcomes, and children’s schooling.\n\n**World Bank variable id:** SG.OWN.LDAL.MA.ZS",
