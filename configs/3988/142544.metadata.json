(2013) of the World Resources Institute – calculate these figures based on the regional percentage losses expressed in the landmark UN FAO report on food losses: FAO (2011). Global food losses and food waste – Extent, causes and prevention. Rome.\n\nThis data is expressed for the year 2009 due to poor data availability and updated estimates since then. It is likely that, especially when expressed in relative terms (each region or food group's contribution to food losses) remains similar today."
