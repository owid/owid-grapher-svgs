Major international \n\nconsultations took place in 2011 and 2012, as well as many regional and country consultations in various \n\nparts of the world. \n\nExisting global norms and standards and technical recommendations for SDG monitoring are documented \n\nhere: http://www.wssinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/resources/Methodological-note-on-monitoring-\n\nSDG-targets-for-WASH-and-wastewater_WHO-UNICEF_8October2015_Final.pdf. \n\nPurpose and rationale for this indicator can also be found in the methods document: \n\nhttp://www.wssinfo.org/post-2015-monitoring/ and summarised in the following methodological note \n\n(p12): http://www.wssinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/resources/Methodological-note-on-monitoring-\n\nSDG-targets-for-WASH-and-wastewater_WHO-UNICEF_8October2015_Final.pdf \n\nRationale: \n\nConcepts: \n\nSee above.

This accounting structure means that these activities cover the whole economy and are considered \n\nfor each industry, which are defined according to the International Standard Industrial Classification of all \n\nEconomic Activities (ISIC), and covering 1) abstraction and distribution of water, 2) discharge, reuse and \n\ntreatment of wastewater, and 3) consumption and returns of water back to the environment, in this \n\naccounting structure, disaggregated by industry in a standardised way. Economic activities by ISIC broadly \n\ncovers agriculture, hazardous industries and other economic activities \n\nComments and limitations: \n\nThe main issue regarding safely managed drinking water services will be comparability of data on the \n\ndefinition of what is considered safe treatment. Although there are international guidelines and \n\nstandards, their compliance by countries is not internationally binding. Countries can set their own \n\nstandards which can vary from international norms and standards. For this reason, country data may not \n\nfollow the international standard that JMP likes to follow for its global monitoring purposes.  \n\nHaving said the above, using MDG experiences of data reconciliation, and working collaboratively with \n\nJMP on this will help reconciling definitional discrepancies and hence variations in estimates. This vast \n\nexperience in dealing with such issues will be very useful in dealing with the above issues for the SDG \n\nperiod. \n\n \nMethodology \n\n\fLast updated: 18 November 2016 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nComputation Method: \n\nThe calculation of the indicator value as derived from the framework is the amount treated (off-site and \n\non-site) divided by the total amount of waste produced. Data on treatment of domestic wastewater will \n\ncome from the multi- purpose indicator 6.2.1. Data on volumes of industrial wastewater can be \n\nestimated from inventories of industries, which will be available in the majority of Member States \n\ndisaggregated by ISIC classifications. The breakdown of treated wastewater can be calculated based on \n\ncompliance records, related to national standards. Unless verified otherwise, through audited compliance \n\nrecords, the waste generated will be considered untreated. \n\nDisaggregation: \n\nSince this indicator is disaggregated for households and non-households (industrial and commercial \n\nestablishments, as per the classification of ISIC Rev4); more can be found on the methods note: \n\nhttp://www.wssinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/resources/Methodological-note-on-monitoring-SDG-\n\ntargets-for-WASH-and-wastewater_WHO-UNICEF_8October2015_Final.pdf. \n\nTreatment of missing values: \n\n•  At country level \n\nThe calculation of the indicator value as derived from the framework is the amount treated (off-site \n\nand on-site) divided by the total amount of waste produced. Data on treatment of domestic \n\nwastewater will come from the multi- purpose indicator 6.2.1. Data on volumes of industrial \n\nwastewater can be estimated from inventories of industries, which will be available in the majority \n\nof Member States disaggregated by ISIC classifications. The breakdown of treated wastewater can \n\nbe calculated based on compliance records, related to national standards. Unless verified \n\notherwise, through audited compliance records, the waste generated will be considered untreated. \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\nNo data is published for countries for which we couldn't find country data \n\nRegional aggregates: \n\nSee methods note mentioned above and 11.2 above. \n\nSources of discrepancies: \n\nWHO is required by World Health Assembly resolution to consult on all WHO statistics, and seek feedback \n\nfrom countries on data about countries and territories. Before publishing all JMP estimates undergo \n\nrigorous country consultations facilitated by WHO and UNICEF country offices. Often these consultations \n\ngive rise to in-country visits, and meetings about data reconciliations. \n\n \nData Sources \n\nDescription: \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLast updated: 18 November 2016 \n\nPreliminary estimates are available for 140 countries for 6.2.1, which is the same as the household part of \n\nthis indicator: http://www-\n\nwds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2016/02/11/090224b084172a75/1_0\n\n/Original/The0costs0of0m0iene000data0catalog.xlsx. \n\nSince the publication of this, joint searches with JMP found national data available for most countries of \n\nthe world.
