The six headings are (1) Personal care; (2) Employment, related activities, and travel; (3) Study; (4) Household and family care; (5) Leisure, social, and associative life; and (6) Travel and unspecified time use. The data has been normalised to 1440 minutes per day. \n\nThe survey population includes private participants only - individuals living in institutions (nursing homes, homes for the elderly, children’s homes, rehabilitation centres and penitentiary) are excluded. For further information on the time use surveys see: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/tus_esms.htm"
