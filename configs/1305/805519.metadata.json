  "descriptionFromProducer": "Literacy is defined as the ability to understand, evaluate, use and engage with written texts to participate in society, to achieve one’s goals, and to develop one’s knowledge and potential. Literacy encompasses a range of skills from the decoding of written words and sentences to the comprehension, interpretation, and evaluation of complex texts. It does not, however, involve the production of text (writing). Information on the skills of adults with low levels of proficiency is provided by an assessment of reading components that covers text vocabulary, sentence comprehension and passage fluency. The target population for the survey was the non institutionalized population, aged 16-65 years, residing in the country at the time of data collection, irrespective of nationality, citizenship or language status. Literacy-related non-respondents are not included in the calculation of the mean scores which, thus, present an upper bound of the estimated literacy proficiency of the population.
