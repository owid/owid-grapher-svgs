that Deplete the Ozone Layer was adopted by Governments in 1987 and has been modified five times so far. Its control provisions were strengthened through four adjustments to the Protocol adopted in London (1990), Copenhagen (1992), Vienna (1995), Montreal (1997) and Beijing (1999). The Protocol aims to reduce and eventually eliminate the emissions of man-made ozone depleting substances"}}},"entityKey":{"81":{"name":"South Africa","code":"ZAF"},"273":{"name":"Africa","code":null},"276":{"name":"Europe","code":null},"294":{"name":"North America","code":null},"295":{"name":"South America","code":null},"302":{"name":"South Asia","code":null},"355":{"name":"World","code":"OWID_WRL"},"436":{"name":"Caribbean","code":null},"462":{"name":"Eastern Africa","code":null},"464":{"name":"Northern Africa","code":null},"465":{"name":"Southern Africa","code":null},"466":{"name":"Western Africa","code":null},"469":{"name":"Central Asia","code":null},"473":{"name":"Eastern Europe","code":null},"476":{"name":"Western Europe","code":null},"34563":{"name":"Central Africa","code":null},"34616":{"name":"Central Europe","code":null},"35101":{"name":"West Asia","code":null},"36474":{"name":"Arabian Peninsula","code":null},"36476":{"name":"Australia + New Zealand","code":null},"36477":{"name":"Mashriq","code":null},"36478":{"name":"Meso America","code":null},"36479":{"name":"North East Asia","code":null},"36480":{"name":"South East Asia","code":null},"36481":{"name":"South Pacific","code":null},"36482":{"name":"Western Indian Ocean","code":null},"36483":{"name":"Asia + Pacific","code":null}}}
