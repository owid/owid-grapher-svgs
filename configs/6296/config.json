        "content": "Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of space-time that are created when two massive objects, such as black holes or neutron stars, collide or interact. They move at the speed of light, but they are extremely difficult to detect because they are so small and faint. It wasn't until the development of advanced technology like LIGO (the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) that we were able to detect these waves for the first time in 2015.",
