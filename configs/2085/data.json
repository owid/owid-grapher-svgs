Compliance  with  reporting  requirements  for  production  and  consumption  of  ozone-depleting \n\nsubstances under (Article 7 of) the Montreal Protocol; \n\n2.  Submission of information on Licensing systems under (Article 4B of) the Montreal Protocol. \n\n1.  Designation  of  a  national  focal  point  for  exchange  of  information  under  Article  17  of  the \n\n2.  Submission of national reports as required under Article 21 of the Minamata Convention. \n\n \nRationale: \nThe proposed indicator is process-oriented, focusing on compliance with the obligations that contribute \nto  the  overall  target  of  achieving  the  environmentally  sound  management  of  chemicals  and  all  wastes \nthroughout their life cycle.  \n \nIt doesn’t measure the quantity of chemicals in media and doesn’t quantify adverse impacts on human \nhealth  and  the  environment.  The  MEAs,  however,  were  developed  and  adopted  to  address  the  most \nurgent challenges for human health and the environment and therefore, through the implementation of \nMEAs progress will be made to reduce release to air, water and soil and well as presence of hazardous \nchemicals in products.  \n \nConcepts: \nParties: countries that have ratified, accepted, approved or accessed a convention. \nInformation: Parties to the Basel Convention have an obligation to present an annual national report as \nprovided for by Article 13, paragraph 3 in order to enable monitoring of the implementation of the Basel \nConvention  by  its  Parties.    The  reports  are  to  contain,  inter  alia,  Information  regarding  transboundary \nmovements  of  hazardous  wastes  or  other  wastes  in  which  Parties  have  been  involved,  including  the \namount of hazardous wastes and other wastes exported, their category, characteristics, destination, any \ntransit country and disposal method as stated on the response to notification, the amount of hazardous \nwastes  and  other  wastes  imported  their  category,  characteristics,  origin,  and  disposal  methods; \ninformation  on  accidents  occurring  during  the  transboundary  movement  and  disposal  of  hazardous \nwastes and other  wastes and on the  measures  undertaken to  deal  with them;  information on  disposal \noptions  operated  within  the  area  of  their  national  jurisdiction;  and  other  information  as  per  reporting \nformat. \n \nImport  responses  under  the  Rotterdam  Convention  are  the  decisions  provided  by  Parties  indicating \nwhether or not they will consent to import the chemicals listed in Annex III of the Convention and subject \nto  the  prior  informed  consent  (PIC)  procedure.  Article  10  of  the  Rotterdam  Convention  sets  out  the \nobligations of Parties with respect to the future import of chemicals listed in Annex III. \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 11 July 2017 \n\n \nUnder  the  Stockholm  Convention  a  Party  has  an  obligation  to  report  on  the  measures  it  has  taken  to \nimplement the provisions of  the Convention and on the effectiveness of such measures in meeting the \nobjectives  of  the  Convention.  The  national  reports  include  statistical  data  on  the  total  quantities  of \nproduction, import and export of each of the chemicals listed in Annex A and Annex B or a reasonable \nestimate of such data; and to the extent practicable, a list of the States from which it has imported each \nsuch substance and the States to which it has exported each such substance. A National Implementation \nPlan  under  the  Stockholm  Convention  is  a  plan  explaining  how  a  Party  is  going  to  implement  the \nobligations under the Convention and make efforts to put such a plan into operation (Article 7). Changes \nin the obligations arising from amendments to the Convention or its annexes, for example when a new \nchemical is listed into the annexes of the Convention, a Party will review and update its implementation \nplan, and transmit the updated plan to the Conference of the Parties within two years of the entry into \nforce of the amendment for it, consistent with paragraph 1 (b) of the Convention (according to paragraph \n7 of the annex to decision SC-1/12).  \n \nComments and limitations: \nThe transmission of information as required by the five Conventions follows a different timing. This is the \nreason  why  the  reporting  to  this  indicator  has  been  scheduled  for  5-year  cycles,  which  would  allow \ncapturing the compliance of Parties with the transmission of information of all the Conventions. \n \nPlease  also  note  that  the  timing  for  submission  of  reporting  for  the  Minamata  Convention  has  not  yet \nbeen agreed on. It is not clear whether any reporting will be required prior to 2020, nor it is clear how \nmany times reporting would be required prior to 2030. Thus, the Minamata Convention is included here, \nbut the reporting is subject to further decisions on this. \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \nIn the following methodology, reporting is to take place in 2017 for the period 2010-2014, in 2020 for the \nperiod 2015-2019, in 2025 for the period 2020-2024 and in 2030 for the period 2025-2029.

Designation  of  a  national  focal  point  for  exchange  of  information  under  Article  17  of  the \n\n2.  Submission of national reports as required under Article 21 of the Minamata Convention. \n\n \nRationale: \nThe proposed indicator is process-oriented, focusing on compliance with the obligations that contribute \nto  the  overall  target  of  achieving  the  environmentally  sound  management  of  chemicals  and  all  wastes \nthroughout their life cycle.  \n \nIt doesn’t measure the quantity of chemicals in media and doesn’t quantify adverse impacts on human \nhealth  and  the  environment.  The  MEAs,  however,  were  developed  and  adopted  to  address  the  most \nurgent challenges for human health and the environment and therefore, through the implementation of \nMEAs progress will be made to reduce release to air, water and soil and well as presence of hazardous \nchemicals in products.  \n \nConcepts: \nParties: countries that have ratified, accepted, approved or accessed a convention. \nInformation: Parties to the Basel Convention have an obligation to present an annual national report as \nprovided for by Article 13, paragraph 3 in order to enable monitoring of the implementation of the Basel \nConvention  by  its  Parties.    The  reports  are  to  contain,  inter  alia,  Information  regarding  transboundary \nmovements  of  hazardous  wastes  or  other  wastes  in  which  Parties  have  been  involved,  including  the \namount of hazardous wastes and other wastes exported, their category, characteristics, destination, any \ntransit country and disposal method as stated on the response to notification, the amount of hazardous \nwastes  and  other  wastes  imported  their  category,  characteristics,  origin,  and  disposal  methods; \ninformation  on  accidents  occurring  during  the  transboundary  movement  and  disposal  of  hazardous \nwastes and other  wastes and on the  measures  undertaken to  deal  with them;  information on  disposal \noptions  operated  within  the  area  of  their  national  jurisdiction;  and  other  information  as  per  reporting \nformat. \n \nImport  responses  under  the  Rotterdam  Convention  are  the  decisions  provided  by  Parties  indicating \nwhether or not they will consent to import the chemicals listed in Annex III of the Convention and subject \nto  the  prior  informed  consent  (PIC)  procedure.  Article  10  of  the  Rotterdam  Convention  sets  out  the \nobligations of Parties with respect to the future import of chemicals listed in Annex III. \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 11 July 2017 \n\n \nUnder  the  Stockholm  Convention  a  Party  has  an  obligation  to  report  on  the  measures  it  has  taken  to \nimplement the provisions of  the Convention and on the effectiveness of such measures in meeting the \nobjectives  of  the  Convention.  The  national  reports  include  statistical  data  on  the  total  quantities  of \nproduction, import and export of each of the chemicals listed in Annex A and Annex B or a reasonable \nestimate of such data; and to the extent practicable, a list of the States from which it has imported each \nsuch substance and the States to which it has exported each such substance. A National Implementation \nPlan  under  the  Stockholm  Convention  is  a  plan  explaining  how  a  Party  is  going  to  implement  the \nobligations under the Convention and make efforts to put such a plan into operation (Article 7). Changes \nin the obligations arising from amendments to the Convention or its annexes, for example when a new \nchemical is listed into the annexes of the Convention, a Party will review and update its implementation \nplan, and transmit the updated plan to the Conference of the Parties within two years of the entry into \nforce of the amendment for it, consistent with paragraph 1 (b) of the Convention (according to paragraph \n7 of the annex to decision SC-1/12).  \n \nComments and limitations: \nThe transmission of information as required by the five Conventions follows a different timing. This is the \nreason  why  the  reporting  to  this  indicator  has  been  scheduled  for  5-year  cycles,  which  would  allow \ncapturing the compliance of Parties with the transmission of information of all the Conventions. \n \nPlease  also  note  that  the  timing  for  submission  of  reporting  for  the  Minamata  Convention  has  not  yet \nbeen agreed on. It is not clear whether any reporting will be required prior to 2020, nor it is clear how \nmany times reporting would be required prior to 2030. Thus, the Minamata Convention is included here, \nbut the reporting is subject to further decisions on this. \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \nIn the following methodology, reporting is to take place in 2017 for the period 2010-2014, in 2020 for the \nperiod 2015-2019, in 2025 for the period 2020-2024 and in 2030 for the period 2025-2029.

Designation  of  a  national  focal  point  for  exchange  of  information  under  Article  17  of  the \n\n2.  Submission of national reports as required under Article 21 of the Minamata Convention. \n\n \nRationale: \nThe proposed indicator is process-oriented, focusing on compliance with the obligations that contribute \nto  the  overall  target  of  achieving  the  environmentally  sound  management  of  chemicals  and  all  wastes \nthroughout their life cycle.  \n \nIt doesn’t measure the quantity of chemicals in media and doesn’t quantify adverse impacts on human \nhealth  and  the  environment.  The  MEAs,  however,  were  developed  and  adopted  to  address  the  most \nurgent challenges for human health and the environment and therefore, through the implementation of \nMEAs progress will be made to reduce release to air, water and soil and well as presence of hazardous \nchemicals in products.  \n \nConcepts: \nParties: countries that have ratified, accepted, approved or accessed a convention. \nInformation: Parties to the Basel Convention have an obligation to present an annual national report as \nprovided for by Article 13, paragraph 3 in order to enable monitoring of the implementation of the Basel \nConvention  by  its  Parties.    The  reports  are  to  contain,  inter  alia,  Information  regarding  transboundary \nmovements  of  hazardous  wastes  or  other  wastes  in  which  Parties  have  been  involved,  including  the \namount of hazardous wastes and other wastes exported, their category, characteristics, destination, any \ntransit country and disposal method as stated on the response to notification, the amount of hazardous \nwastes  and  other  wastes  imported  their  category,  characteristics,  origin,  and  disposal  methods; \ninformation  on  accidents  occurring  during  the  transboundary  movement  and  disposal  of  hazardous \nwastes and other  wastes and on the  measures  undertaken to  deal  with them;  information on  disposal \noptions  operated  within  the  area  of  their  national  jurisdiction;  and  other  information  as  per  reporting \nformat. \n \nImport  responses  under  the  Rotterdam  Convention  are  the  decisions  provided  by  Parties  indicating \nwhether or not they will consent to import the chemicals listed in Annex III of the Convention and subject \nto  the  prior  informed  consent  (PIC)  procedure.  Article  10  of  the  Rotterdam  Convention  sets  out  the \nobligations of Parties with respect to the future import of chemicals listed in Annex III. \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 11 July 2017 \n\n \nUnder  the  Stockholm  Convention  a  Party  has  an  obligation  to  report  on  the  measures  it  has  taken  to \nimplement the provisions of  the Convention and on the effectiveness of such measures in meeting the \nobjectives  of  the  Convention.  The  national  reports  include  statistical  data  on  the  total  quantities  of \nproduction, import and export of each of the chemicals listed in Annex A and Annex B or a reasonable \nestimate of such data; and to the extent practicable, a list of the States from which it has imported each \nsuch substance and the States to which it has exported each such substance. A National Implementation \nPlan  under  the  Stockholm  Convention  is  a  plan  explaining  how  a  Party  is  going  to  implement  the \nobligations under the Convention and make efforts to put such a plan into operation (Article 7). Changes \nin the obligations arising from amendments to the Convention or its annexes, for example when a new \nchemical is listed into the annexes of the Convention, a Party will review and update its implementation \nplan, and transmit the updated plan to the Conference of the Parties within two years of the entry into \nforce of the amendment for it, consistent with paragraph 1 (b) of the Convention (according to paragraph \n7 of the annex to decision SC-1/12).  \n \nComments and limitations: \nThe transmission of information as required by the five Conventions follows a different timing. This is the \nreason  why  the  reporting  to  this  indicator  has  been  scheduled  for  5-year  cycles,  which  would  allow \ncapturing the compliance of Parties with the transmission of information of all the Conventions. \n \nPlease  also  note  that  the  timing  for  submission  of  reporting  for  the  Minamata  Convention  has  not  yet \nbeen agreed on. It is not clear whether any reporting will be required prior to 2020, nor it is clear how \nmany times reporting would be required prior to 2030. Thus, the Minamata Convention is included here, \nbut the reporting is subject to further decisions on this. \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \nIn the following methodology, reporting is to take place in 2017 for the period 2010-2014, in 2020 for the \nperiod 2015-2019, in 2025 for the period 2020-2024 and in 2030 for the period 2025-2029.

Compliance  with  reporting  requirements  for  production  and  consumption  of  ozone-depleting \n\nsubstances under (Article 7 of) the Montreal Protocol; \n\n2.  Submission of information on Licensing systems under (Article 4B of) the Montreal Protocol. \n\n1.  Designation  of  a  national  focal  point  for  exchange  of  information  under  Article  17  of  the \n\n2.  Submission of national reports as required under Article 21 of the Minamata Convention. \n\n \nRationale: \nThe proposed indicator is process-oriented, focusing on compliance with the obligations that contribute \nto  the  overall  target  of  achieving  the  environmentally  sound  management  of  chemicals  and  all  wastes \nthroughout their life cycle.  \n \nIt doesn’t measure the quantity of chemicals in media and doesn’t quantify adverse impacts on human \nhealth  and  the  environment.  The  MEAs,  however,  were  developed  and  adopted  to  address  the  most \nurgent challenges for human health and the environment and therefore, through the implementation of \nMEAs progress will be made to reduce release to air, water and soil and well as presence of hazardous \nchemicals in products.  \n \nConcepts: \nParties: countries that have ratified, accepted, approved or accessed a convention. \nInformation: Parties to the Basel Convention have an obligation to present an annual national report as \nprovided for by Article 13, paragraph 3 in order to enable monitoring of the implementation of the Basel \nConvention  by  its  Parties.    The  reports  are  to  contain,  inter  alia,  Information  regarding  transboundary \nmovements  of  hazardous  wastes  or  other  wastes  in  which  Parties  have  been  involved,  including  the \namount of hazardous wastes and other wastes exported, their category, characteristics, destination, any \ntransit country and disposal method as stated on the response to notification, the amount of hazardous \nwastes  and  other  wastes  imported  their  category,  characteristics,  origin,  and  disposal  methods; \ninformation  on  accidents  occurring  during  the  transboundary  movement  and  disposal  of  hazardous \nwastes and other  wastes and on the  measures  undertaken to  deal  with them;  information on  disposal \noptions  operated  within  the  area  of  their  national  jurisdiction;  and  other  information  as  per  reporting \nformat. \n \nImport  responses  under  the  Rotterdam  Convention  are  the  decisions  provided  by  Parties  indicating \nwhether or not they will consent to import the chemicals listed in Annex III of the Convention and subject \nto  the  prior  informed  consent  (PIC)  procedure.  Article  10  of  the  Rotterdam  Convention  sets  out  the \nobligations of Parties with respect to the future import of chemicals listed in Annex III. \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 11 July 2017 \n\n \nUnder  the  Stockholm  Convention  a  Party  has  an  obligation  to  report  on  the  measures  it  has  taken  to \nimplement the provisions of  the Convention and on the effectiveness of such measures in meeting the \nobjectives  of  the  Convention.  The  national  reports  include  statistical  data  on  the  total  quantities  of \nproduction, import and export of each of the chemicals listed in Annex A and Annex B or a reasonable \nestimate of such data; and to the extent practicable, a list of the States from which it has imported each \nsuch substance and the States to which it has exported each such substance. A National Implementation \nPlan  under  the  Stockholm  Convention  is  a  plan  explaining  how  a  Party  is  going  to  implement  the \nobligations under the Convention and make efforts to put such a plan into operation (Article 7). Changes \nin the obligations arising from amendments to the Convention or its annexes, for example when a new \nchemical is listed into the annexes of the Convention, a Party will review and update its implementation \nplan, and transmit the updated plan to the Conference of the Parties within two years of the entry into \nforce of the amendment for it, consistent with paragraph 1 (b) of the Convention (according to paragraph \n7 of the annex to decision SC-1/12).  \n \nComments and limitations: \nThe transmission of information as required by the five Conventions follows a different timing. This is the \nreason  why  the  reporting  to  this  indicator  has  been  scheduled  for  5-year  cycles,  which  would  allow \ncapturing the compliance of Parties with the transmission of information of all the Conventions. \n \nPlease  also  note  that  the  timing  for  submission  of  reporting  for  the  Minamata  Convention  has  not  yet \nbeen agreed on. It is not clear whether any reporting will be required prior to 2020, nor it is clear how \nmany times reporting would be required prior to 2030. Thus, the Minamata Convention is included here, \nbut the reporting is subject to further decisions on this. \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \nIn the following methodology, reporting is to take place in 2017 for the period 2010-2014, in 2020 for the \nperiod 2015-2019, in 2025 for the period 2020-2024 and in 2030 for the period 2025-2029.
