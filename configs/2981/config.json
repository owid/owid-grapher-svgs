For example, 23 countries set a threshold of 2000 inhabitants or more in order to be classified as an urban area. There is no consistent definition of what constitutes an 'urban area'. This is highly variable across countries. For many countries, there is no defined threshold based on inhabitants; other metrics such as population density, infrastructure, or even pre-defined cities may be used.",
