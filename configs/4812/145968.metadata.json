This includes not only direct emissions from agriculture, but also land use change and supply chain emissions (transport, packaging, food processing, retail, consumer cooking, refrigeration and waste).\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions are quantified on the basis of their 100-year global warming potential (GWP100) using emission factors from the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5)."
