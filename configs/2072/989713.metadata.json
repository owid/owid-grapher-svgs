    "Disbursements refer to money actually given/received, which can differ from what was originally pledged. These are also net disbursements: grants and loans are valued in the same way by recording the flows of cash that were granted, or the face value of loans that were lent to developing countries, deducting any loan repayments. The method does not reflect actual efforts by donor countries, given that grants and loans themselves represent different efforts from donors. From 2018, headline figures from the OECD are based on the [grant-equivalent methodology](#dod:grant-equivalents), which is a more accurate reflection of the effort made by donor countries.",
