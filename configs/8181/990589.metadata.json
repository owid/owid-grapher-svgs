    "Official development assistance (ODA) eligibility criteria are based on (i) country eligibility, (ii) concessionality, and (iii) the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as the main objective. This means that (i) only countries and territories included in the list of ODA recipients are eligible to receive this assistance, (ii) lending is defined by minimum requirements according to the income category of the recipient country, and (iii) reporting rules have been implemented to define what is \"primarily developmental\". For more details about ODA, please refer to the [official OECD documentation](https://one.oecd.org/document/DCD/DAC/STAT(2023)9/FINAL/en/pdf).",
    "Commodity aid / General programme assistance aid includes general budget support, development food assistance and other commodity assistance.",
    "Aid by sector is presented as commitment or gross disbursement data. Commitments refer to money pledged, and may be different from how much and how it is ultimately given/received. Gross disbursements measure total new flows given/received before repayments are deducted. Net disbursements are not used because there is no evidence that the source of financing to reimburse loans in a sector is actually the sector itself.",
    "Official development assistance does not include military aid, except for the cost of using armed forces to deliver humanitarian aid. It also excludes most peacekeeping expenditures, except for those closely related to development. Nuclear energy is included only if it is for civilian purposes, and cultural programs are eligible only if they build the cultural capacities of recipient countries.",
    "The data is measured in constant 2022 US$ – this adjusts for inflation.",
    "The [OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC)](https://www.oecd.org/en/about/committees/development-assistance-committee.html) maintains a list of territories where ODA can be provided. The countries and territories on the DAC list of ODA recipients consist of all low and middle income countries based on gross national income (GNI) per capita as published by the World Bank, with the exception of former G8 members, EU members, and countries with a firm date for entry into the EU. The list also includes all of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) as defined by the United Nations. The list is updated every three years and is available in [the OECD website](https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/sub-issues/oda-eligibility-and-conditions/dac-list-of-oda-recipients.html)."
