    "Official development assistance (ODA) is aid given to countries and territories on the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) list of recipients and multilateral development institutions. To qualify as ODA, the aid has to serve the economic development and welfare of recipient countries and be either a grant or a loan with favorable terms.",
    "DAC country recipients are all low- and middle-income countries as defined by the World Bank, or least-developed countries as defined by the United Nations. All recipients are listed on [the OECD website](https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/sub-issues/oda-eligibility-and-conditions/dac-list-of-oda-recipients.html).",
    "Most ODA is provided by [DAC members](https://www.oecd.org/en/about/committees/development-assistance-committee.html), which are major aid donors in the OECD plus the European Union. However, some non-DAC countries, such as Turkey or Saudi Arabia, also give aid that follows ODA guidelines.",
    "ODA does not include military aid, except for the cost of using armed forces to deliver humanitarian aid. It also excludes spending on peacekeeping unless it is closely related to development.",
    "Multi-sector / Cross-cutting aid includes aid that is not sector-specific, such as aid for general environmental protection not allocable by sector.",
    "Aid by sector is presented as commitment or gross disbursement data. Commitments refer to money pledged, and may be different from how much and how it is ultimately given/received. Gross disbursements measure total new flows given/received before repayments are deducted. Net disbursements are not used because there is no evidence that the source of financing to reimburse loans in a sector is actually the sector itself.",
    "The OECD adjusts this data for inflation and expresses it in constant 2022 US$. It makes this adjustment using annual average market exchange rates and GDP deflators for each donor country. For more information on the methodology, visit [the OECD's documentation](https://www.oecd.org/content/oecd/en/data/insights/data-explainers/2024/10/resources-for-reporting-development-finance-statistics.html) on DAC deflators."
