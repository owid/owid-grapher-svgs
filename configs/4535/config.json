Greenhouse gases absorb radiation that is radiated by Earth, preventing this heat from escaping to space.\n\nCarbon dioxide (CO₂) is the most well-known greenhouse gas, but there are others including methane, nitrous oxide, and in fact, water vapor.\n\nHuman-made emissions of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels, industry, and agriculture are the leading cause of global climate change. \n",
