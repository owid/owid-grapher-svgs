  "descriptionShort": "This includes all alcohol-defined offences (e.g. drunkenness offences, driving with excess alcohol, liquor licence violations) and offences in which the consumption of alcohol is thought to have played a role of some kind in the committing of the offence (e.g., assault, breach of the peace, criminal damage and other public order offences).",
  "descriptionFromProducer": "##### Rationale\nAlcohol-related crime contributes to the harm experienced by the population as a whole. It is therefore an important indicator in evaluating, in an indirect way, the harm and consequences of alcohol use on the population.\n\n##### Definition\nThis includes all alcohol-defined offences (e.g. drunkenness offences, driving with excess alcohol, liquor licence violations) and offences in which the consumption of alcohol is thought to have played a role of some kind in the committing of the offence (e.g., assault, breach of the peace, criminal damage and other public order offences).\n\n##### Method of estimation\nNumber of alcohol-related crimes in a country in a given year, divided by the number of all crimes in the same year multiplied by 100.",
