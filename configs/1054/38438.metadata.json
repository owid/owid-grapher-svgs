    "additionalInfo": "The female labor force participation (FLFP) index was calculated by OWID based on FLFP data compiled from Olivetti (2013). The original data shows FLFP as percentage of the female population that is economically active. Olivetti compiled data from Mitchell (1998) and the International Labor Organization.\n\nFor more detail see: http://www.nber.org/papers/w19131.pdf.\nThe index measures FLFP as an index to 1900. This was calculated by dividing FLFP in each year by FLFP in 1900 (therefore 1900 = 100). Values less than 100 indicate a decrease in FLFP relative to 1900; values greater than 100 indicate an increase in FLFP relative to 1900."
