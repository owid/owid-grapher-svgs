        "content": "Global warming potential (GWP) measures the amount of heat absorbed by a greenhouse gas relative to the same mass of carbon dioxide (CO₂). It measures the amount of warming a gas creates compared to CO₂.\n\nCarbon dioxide is given a GWP value of one. If a gas had a GWP of 10 then one kilogram of that gas would generate ten times the warming effect as one kilogram of CO₂.\n\nSince greenhouse gases spend different amounts of time in the atmosphere, their global warming potential depends on the length of time that it’s measured over. For example, GWP can be measured as the warming effect over 20 years, 50 years, or 100 years.\n\nPotent but short-lived greenhouse gases – like methane, for example – will have a higher GWP when measured over 20 years than over 100 years.\n\nThe GWP value for methane over 100 years (GWP100) is 28. This means one kilogram of methane would cause 28 times the warming of one kilogram of CO₂.",
