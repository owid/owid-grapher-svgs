  "description": "Aguiar and Hurst (2006) define \"core\" market work to \"include all time spent working in the market sector on main jobs, second jobs, and overtime, including any time spent working at home. This market-work measure is analogous to the market work measures in the Census, the Panel Survey of Income Dynamics (PSID), or the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF).\n\nThe broader category \"total\" market work is core market work plus time spent commuting to/from work and time spent on ancillary work activities (e.g. time spent at work on breaks or eating a meal).\"\n\nNote non-market work excludes child care which has been included as a separate category altogether.\n\nAguiar and Hurst define three categories of time spent in non-market production. Time spent on an activity includes any time spent on transportation associated with that activity. \n1. Time spent on \"core\" housework. This includes any time spent on meal preparation and cleanup, doing laundry, ironing, dusting, vacuuming, indoor household cleaning, indoor design and maintenance (including painting and decorating), etc.\n2. Time spent “obtaining goods and services.” This category includes all time spent\nacquiring any goods or services (excluding medical care, education, and restaurant meals). Examples include grocery shopping, shopping for other household items, comparison shopping,\ncoupon clipping, going to the bank, going to a barber, going to the post office, buying goods online, etc.\n3. Total non-market work includes time spent in core household chores, time spent obtaining goods and services, plus time spent on other home production such as home maintenance, outdoor cleaning, vehicle repair, gardening, pet care, etc. This latter category is designed to be a complete measure of non‐market work.",
