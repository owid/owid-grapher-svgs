promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage \nforests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss \nTarget 15.b: Mobilize significant resources from all sources and at all levels to finance sustainable forest \nmanagement and provide adequate incentives to developing countries to advance such management, \nincluding for conservation and reforestation \nIndicator 15.b.1: Official development assistance and public expenditure on conservation and \nsustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystems \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \n \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n \nDefinition: \n \nThe indicator Official development assistance and public expenditure on conservation and sustainable \nuse of biodiversity and ecosystems is defined as Gross disbursements of total ODA from all donors for \nbiodiversity. \n \nRationale: \n \nTotal ODA flows to developing countries quantify the public effort that donors provide to developing \ncountries for biodiversity. \n \nConcepts: \n \nODA: The DAC defines ODA as “those flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients \nand to multilateral institutions which are i) provided by official agencies, including state and local \ngovernments, or by their executive agencies; and ii) each transaction is administered with the promotion \nof the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and is \nconcessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent (calculated at a rate of \ndiscount of 10 per cent). (See \nhttp://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm) \n \nODA marked for biodiversity is captured through the CRS via a marker. \n \n‘All donors’ refers to DAC donors, non-DAC donors and multilateral organisations.  \n \nComments and limitations: \n \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\nData in the Creditor Reporting System are available from 1973. However, the data coverage is considered \ncomplete from 1995 for commitments at an activity level and 2002 for disbursements. \n \nThe biodiversity marker was introduced in 2002. \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \n \nThe sum of ODA flows from all donors to developing countries that have biodiversity as a principal or \nsignificant objective. \n \nDisaggregation: \n \nThis indicator can be disaggregated by donor, recipient country, type of finance, type of aid, sector, etc. \n \nTreatment of missing values: \n \n\n•  At country level \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\n \nNone \n \n\n \nNone \n \n\nRegional aggregates: \n \nGlobal and regional figures are based on the sum of ODA flows for biodiversity. \n \nSources of discrepancies: \n \nDAC statistics are standardized on a calendar year basis for all donors and may differ from fiscal year data \navailable in budget documents for some countries. \n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \n \nThe OECD/DAC has been collecting data on official and private resource flows from 1960 at an aggregate \nlevel and 1973 at an activity level through the Creditor Reporting System (CRS data are considered \ncomplete from 1995 for commitments at an activity level and 2002 for disbursements). \n \nThe biodiversity marker was introduced in 2002. \n \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\nThe data are reported by donors according to the same standards and methodologies (see here: \nhttp://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm). \n \nData are reported on an annual calendar year basis by statistical reporters in national administrations (aid \nagencies, Ministries of Foreign Affairs or Finance, etc. \n \nCollection process: \n \nA statistical reporter is responsible for the collection of DAC statistics in each providing country/agency. \nThis reporter is usually located in the national aid agency, Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Finance etc. \n \nData Availability \n\n \nOn a donor basis for all DAC countries and many non-DAC providers (bilateral and multilateral) that \nreport to the DAC on sector level data. \n \nOn a recipient basis for all developing countries eligible for ODA. \n \nCalendar \n\n \nData collection: \n \nData are published on an annual basis in December for flows in the previous year.
