  "descriptionProcessing": "The number of large-scale AI systems by country is determined by tallying the number of machine learning models that are associated with the geographical location of the researchers' affiliated institutions. It's important to note that a single model can have multiple authors, each potentially affiliated with different institutions, thus contributing to the count for multiple countries.",

      "description": "A dataset that tracks compute-intensive AI models, with training compute over 10²³ floating point operations (FLOP). This corresponds to training costs of hundreds of thousands of dollars or more.\n\nTo identify compute-intensive AI models, the team at Epoch AI used various resources, estimating compute when not directly reported. They included benchmarks and repositories, such as Papers With Code and Hugging Face, to find models exceeding 10²³ FLOP. They also explored non-English media and specific leaderboards, particularly focusing on Chinese sources.\n\nAdditionally, they examined blog posts, press releases from major labs, and scholarly literature to track new models. A separate table was created for models with unconfirmed but plausible compute levels. Despite thorough methods, proprietary and secretive models may have been missed.",
