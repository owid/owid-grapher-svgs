    "When an individual visits a country multiple times within a year, each visit is counted as a separate arrival.",
    "Similarly, if a person travels to multiple countries during a single trip, their arrival in each country is recorded individually.",
    "As a result, the number of arrivals does not necessarily reflect the number of individuals traveling, as one person can generate multiple arrivals.",
    "Note that before 2006, the US counted same-day trips from Canada only. After 2006, day trips from Mexico were also included.",
    "The underlying premise behind this indicator is that the country linked to the arrival should correspond to the individual's country of residence.",
    "However, it is worth noting that certain countries deviate from UNWTO recommendations and classify their nationals residing abroad as a distinct category, rather than considering them as residents of those countries."
