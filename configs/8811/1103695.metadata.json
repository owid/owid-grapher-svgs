ClinicalTrials.gov has four sponsor categories: Trials funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), other US federal agencies (e.g., [FDA](#dod:us-fda), industry (e.g., pharmaceutical companies), and other sponsors (e.g., non-US governments, academic institutions, non-profits, and other people or entities).\n",

This support may include activities related to funding, design, implementation, data analysis, or reporting. Organizations listed as sponsors and collaborators for a study are considered the funders of the study. ClinicalTrials.gov refers to four types of funders:\n\n- U.S. National Institutes of Health\n- Other U.S. Federal agencies (for example, Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs)\n- Industry (for example: pharmaceutical and device companies)\n- All others (including individuals, universities, and community-based organizations)",

As these are not officially defined categories, but rather subcategories of the \"Other\" category, they are grouped under \"Other\" in this dataset."
