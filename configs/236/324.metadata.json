International $ are adjusted for price differences between countries and for price changes over time (inflation).\n\nThis visualization can be found in Ravallion (2016) – The Economics of Poverty: History, Measurement, and Policy. Oxford University Press. 28 January 2016. 736 Pages.\n\nWe have updated the visualization from Ravallion (2016) using the same sources the author relies on: Bourguignon and Morrison (2002) for the historical estimates and the World Bank for data from 1981 onwards. \n\nAll poverty estimates 1981 and later are taken from the World Bank's Povcal Net: iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/ (downloaded in February 2019).\nAll data from 1980 and earlier is taken from Bourguignon and Morrisson (2002) – Inequality Among World Citizens: 1820–1992. In American Economic Review, 92, 4, 727–748. Bourguignon and Morrisson (2002) state that 'the poverty lines were calibrated so that poverty and extreme poverty headcounts in 1992 coincided roughly with estimates from other sources’; here we rely on the midpoint of the two series published by Bourguignon and Morrison. \n\nThe absolute number of the world population is taken from the OurWorldInData world population data set: https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth.
