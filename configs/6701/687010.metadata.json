    "additionalInfo": "\nThis dataset, from the work of Kristopher Velasco (2020), provides a country’s LGBT+ policy landscape by capturing the implementation of 18 different LGBT+ policies. Policies included in the index are limited to those adopted across at least three countries or are explicitly advocated for by transnational activists.\n\nThese policies are subdivided between:\n\n  Progressive policies:\n    1. Same-Sex Sexual Acts Legal\n    2. Equal Age of Consent\n    3. Employment Discrimination\n    4. Hate Crime Protections\n    5. Incitement to Hatred\n    6. Civil Unions\n    7. Marriage Equality\n    8. Joint Adoptions\n    9. Gender Marker Change\n    10. LGB Military\n    11. Transgender Military\n    12. Ban on Conversion Therapies\n    13. Ban on Gender Assignment Surgeries on Children\n\n  Regressive policies\n    1. Death Penalty for Same-Sex Sexual Acts\n    2. Propaganda Laws\n    3. Same-Sex Sexual Acts Illegal\n    4. Unequal Age of Consent\n    5. Ban on Marriage Equality\n\nEach of these policies score in a range between 0 and 1, according to their level of implementation. Together, they form the LGBT+ Policy Index.\n\nAdditional policies are included in the dataset, as constitutional protections against discrimination, LGB military ban and third gender recognition.\n\nMultiple sources were consulted to find the necessary data to construct this index. The primary data source was the State Sponsored Homophobia Reports produced by ILGA. These reports, produced almost annually, outline the adoption of various policies and provide some information on implementation. For information on trans- and intersex-specific policies and military information, other sources were used, including the Trans Legal Mapping Report, also produced by ILGA, reports and documentation provided by Transgender Europe, Movement Advancement Project, The Hague Center for Strategic Studies LGBT+ Military Index, and academic studies such as Reynolds (2013). Furthermore, multiple sources were used to obtain data on the evidence of enforcement – particularly arrests – including an extensive newspaper search across each country using LexisNexis and Factiva and other external reports by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and the U.S. State Department."
