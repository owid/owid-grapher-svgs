In order to better understand alcohol consumption, we need to combine this information with other information on who drinks and in what pattern. The number of lifetime abstainers provides such information by separating out the drinking from the non-drinking population.\n\nDefinition\nLifetime abstainers is defined as the proportion of adults (15+ years) in a given population who have not consumed any alcohol during their lifetime, assessed at a given point in time. Numerator: The number of lifetime abstainers (15+ years). Denominator: The total number of participants (15+ years) responding to the corresponding question in a given survey. Weighted by survey design.\n\nAssociated terms\n\n    \n\nPreferred data sources\nPopulation-based surveys\n\nOther possible data sources\n\n    \n\nMethod of measurement\nA representative sample of the adult population (15+ years) of the country is asked to answer questions in a survey. The first priority in the decision tree is given to international surveys (in this order of preference: WHS, STEPS, GENACIS, and ECAS); second is national surveys.\n\nMethod of estimation\nStatistical analyses based on surveys, weighted to be representative for the population.\n\nM&E Framework\n\n    \n\nMethod of estimation of global and regional aggregates\nAverage of countries with
