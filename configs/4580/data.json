Wasting in children is defined as having a weight less than two standard deviations below the median for their height.","createdAt":"2020-10-03T08:37:54.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T08:55:25.000Z","code":null,"coverage":"","timespan":"","datasetId":5192,"sourceId":17922,"shortUnit":null,"display":{"name":"Number of children who are wasted","unit":"children","includeInTable":true,"numDecimalPlaces":0},"columnOrder":0,"originalMetadata":null,"datasetName":"Global Health Indicators – Number of People (2020)","s_id":17922,"s_name":"Calculated by Our World in Data based on WHO/UNICEF or IHME and UN Population Division (2019)","source":{"id":17922,"name":"Calculated by Our World in Data based on WHO/UNICEF or IHME and UN Population Division (2019)","dataPublishedBy":"","dataPublisherSource":"","link":"","retrievedData":"","additionalInfo":"This dataset was calculated by Our World in Data based on the combination of multiple input sources.
