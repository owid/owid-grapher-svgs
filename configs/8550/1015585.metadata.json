    "We have combined some categories for presentation purposes: \"children\" include related and household children under 18, grandchildren and other related children under 18, \"friends\" include roommates or lodgers and \"partner\" includes spouses, boy-/girlfriends, and co-habiting partners.",
    "Time spent with multiple people can be counted more than once (e.g., attending a party with friends and partner counts toward both \"friends\" and \"partner\").",
    "The \"Other\" category includes all other relationships not covered by the other categories, such as neighbors, customers or non-related, non-household children.",
    "ATUS data were not collected during the period March 18, 2020 to May 9, 2020, which coincided with a time when most residents of the United States were encouraged to stay home to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, data collected for 2020 is not representative of the entire year."
