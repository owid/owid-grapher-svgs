Source: [Section 6(2), Animal Welfare Act.](https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&Gesetzesnummer=20003541) Date effective: 2022-07-18. The prohibition was adopted in July 2022 through a law amending the Animal Welfare Act. Scope excludes male chicks used as feed in zoos or for birds of prey. Destruction of non-hatched is allowed up until 14 day of incubation.\n- France: Banned. Source: [R 214-17 of the Rural Code.](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000028969470) Date effective: 2022-12-31. The prohibition was adopted on January 2022 through a regulation. In ovo sexing technologies benefit from a five-year nonobsolescence clause. Male chicks for animal food production benefit from an exemption. Destruction of non-hatched is allowed up until 15 day of incubation.\n- Germany: Banned. Source: [Section 3 (4c), Animal Welfare Act.](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/tierschg/BJNR012770972.html) Date effective: 2022-01-01. The prohibition was adopted on January 2022, through a regulation which prohibits the culling of one-day old chicks by 2022, and the culling of fertilized eggs passed the 6th day of incubation. Note: No derogation.\n- Italy: Banned but not yet in effect. Source: [Article 18, European Delegation Law (22G00136).](https://www.normattiva.it/uri-res/N2Ls?urn:nir:stato:legge:2022-08-04;127) Date effective: 2026-12-31. The law prohibits the selective killing of male chicks by December 31st, 2026 and provides exemptions for animal protection purposes only. A decree will later specify the ways in which the law should be implemented. The law does not provide a rule regarding the destruction of non-hatched eggs nor exemptions, other than exemptions for animal health and protection purposes.
