'Vaccines are important for children to have'.\n\n(2) Do you strongly or somewhat agree, strongly or somewhat disagree or neither agree nor disagree with the following statement? 'Vaccines are safe.'\n\n(3) Do you strongly or somewhat agree, strongly or somewhat disagree or neither agree nor disagree with the following statement?
