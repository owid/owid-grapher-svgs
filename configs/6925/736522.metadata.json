    "additionalInfo": "Annually, the IFR publishes the World Robotics Report, which provides comprehensive insights into global trends concerning robot installations.\n\nBy monitoring the installation of industrial robots, which often incorporate AI-based software technologies, it becomes feasible to gather valuable information about the implementation of AI-ready infrastructure in real-world scenarios. This data is sourced from the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), a nonprofit organization dedicated to the advancement and safeguarding of the robotics industry.\n\nThe AI Index is an independent initiative at the Stanford University Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. The mission of the AI Index is “to provide unbiased, rigorously vetted, and globally sourced data for policymakers, researchers, executives, journalists, and the general public to develop intuitions about the complex field of AI.” Their flagship output is the annual AI Index Report, which has been published since 2017.\n"
