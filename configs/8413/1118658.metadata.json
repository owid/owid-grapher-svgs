The major HFD output includes detailed data on births, unconditional and conditional fertility rates, cohort and period fertility tables as well as selected aggregate indicators such as total fertility rates, mean ages at childbearing, and parity progression ratios.\n\nFor each country, there are four blocks of data provided:\n\n- Summary Indicators\n- Age-Specific Data\n- Fertility Tables\n- Input Data\n\nMore details at https://www.humanfertility.org/Data/ExplanatoryNotes, and https://www.humanfertility.org/File/GetDocumentFree/Docs/methods.pdf.",
