A qualified teacher is one who has the minimum academic qualifications necessary to teach at a specific level of education in a given country. This is usually related to the subject(s) they teach. The percentage of qualified teachers should not exceed 100%. When feasible, the number of part-time teachers should be converted to ‘full-time equivalent’ numbers of teachers; a double-shift teacher should be counted twice, etc. Ideally, all staff involved in direct classroom-teaching roles should be included in the calculations. High values indicate that students are being taught by teachers who are academically well qualified in the subjects they teach.","createdAt":"2017-09-10T12:24:06.000Z","updatedAt":"2018-02-28T08:58:51.000Z","code":"UIS.QUTP.3","coverage":"","timespan":"1970-2100","datasetId":886,"sourceId":5414,"shortUnit":"%","display":{},"columnOrder":0,"originalMetadata":null,"datasetName":"World Bank EdStats - Teachers","s_id":5414,"s_name":"World Bank EdStats: Percentage of teachers in upper secondary education who are qualified, both sexes (%)","source":{"id":5414,"name":"World Bank EdStats: Percentage of teachers in upper secondary education who are qualified, both sexes (%)","dataPublishedBy":"World Bank EdStats","dataPublisherSource":"UNESCO Institute for Statistics","link":"https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/ed-stats","retrievedData":"","additionalInfo":""}}},"entityKey":{"16":{"name":"Albania","code":"ALB"},"27":{"name":"Bahrain","code":"BHR"},"28":{"name":"Bangladesh","code":"BGD"},"30":{"name":"Belarus","code":"BLR"},"31":{"name":"Belize","code":"BLZ"},"32":{"name":"Benin","code":"BEN"},"38":{"name":"Brunei","code":"BRN"},"41":{"name":"Burundi","code":"BDI"},"43":{"name":"Cameroon","code":"CMR"},"45":{"name":"Cape Verde","code":"CPV"},"61":{"name":"Yemen","code":"YEM"},"65":{"name":"Egypt","code":"EGY"},"87":{"name":"Sierra Leone","code":"SLE"},"88":{"name":"Serbia","code":"SRB"},"90":{"name":"Saudi Arabia","code":"SAU"},"93":{"name":"Puerto Rico","code":"PRI"},"100":{"name":"Panama","code":"PAN"},"104":{"name":"Niger","code":"NER"},"107":{"name":"Nepal","code":"NPL"},"109":{"name":"Mozambique","code":"MOZ"},"118":{"name":"Madagascar","code":"MDG"},"125":{"name":"Laos","code":"LAO"},"135":{"name":"Iran","code":"IRN"},"140":{"name":"Palestine","code":"PSE"},"150":{"name":"Ghana","code":"GHA"},"151":{"name":"Gambia","code":"GMB"},"154":{"name":"Djibouti","code":"DJI"},"157":{"name":"Eritrea","code":"ERI"},"160":{"name":"Dominican Republic","code":"DOM"},"164":{"name":"Cuba","code":"CUB"},"170":{"name":"Colombia","code":"COL"},"194":{"name":"Bermuda","code":"BMU"},"200":{"name":"Dominica","code":"DMA"},"206":{"name":"Grenada","code":"GRD"},"215":{"name":"Montenegro","code":"MNE"},"226":{"name":"Qatar","code":"QAT"},"239":{"name":"Samoa","code":"WSM"},"262":{"name":"Macao","code":"MAC"}}}
