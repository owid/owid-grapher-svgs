He defines total social expenditure as social transfers plus public expenditure on education. However, the OECD Social Expenditure Database (SOCX) does not include expenditure on education.\n\nAccording to Lindert (2004), total social transfers correspond to basic assistance to poor families [alias “poor relief” (before 1930), “family assistance,” “welfare” (in America), or “supplemental income”], unemployment compensation, (alias “the dole”), public non-contributory pensions (in which the funds come from persons other than the recipient and his or her employer), public health expenditures, and housing subsidies."
