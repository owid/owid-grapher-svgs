    "In a recent paper by Diaconu et al. (2022), the authors propose the modal age at death for measuring occupational inequalities at older ages in Finland. They compare trends in modal age at death with those of more conventional measures of mortality at older ages, such as life expectancy at age 65, 75.",
    "Compared to life expectancy at birth or at age 65, the modal age has the advantages of being: (i) determined solely by mortality at older ages, (ii) free from an arbitrary choice of \"old\" age threshold, and (iii) compares individuals with similar survival chances over time.",
    "The estimates by sex for Finland and the G7 countries, i.e., Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, are estimated from country- and sex-specific smooth distributions of ages at death (Diaconu et al. 2022). Because death rates at very old ages are often noisy and vary from one age to the next, precise identification of the modal age requires that death rates be smoothed with penalized B-splines (P-splines).",
    "Observed deaths and population exposures by single year of age (10 years and older) and sex, used to smooth the mortality rates, are taken from the Human Mortality Database."

      "description": "Indicators based a fixed “old” age threshold have been widely used for assessing socioeconomic disparities in mortality at older ages. Interpretation of long-term trends and determinants of these indicators is challenging because mortality above a fixed age that in the past would have reflected old age deaths is today mixing premature and old-age mortality. We propose the modal (i.e., most frequent) age at death, M, an indicator increasingly recognized in aging research, but which has been infrequently used for monitoring mortality disparities at older ages. We use mortality and population exposure data by occupational class over the 1971-2017 period from Finnish register data. The modal age and life expectancy indicators are estimated from mortality rates smoothed with penalized B-splines. Over the 1971-2017 period, occupational class disparities in life expectancy at 65 and 75 widened while disparities in M remained relatively stable. The proportion of the group surviving to the modal age was constant across time and occupational class. In contrast, the proportion surviving to age 65 and 75 has roughly doubled since 1971 and showed strong occupational class differences. Increasing socioeconomic disparities in mortality based on fixed old age thresholds may be a feature of changing selection dynamics in a context of overall declining mortality. Unlike life expectancy at a selected fixed old age, M compares individuals with similar survival chances over time and across occupational classes. This property makes trends and differentials in M easier to interpret in countries where old-age survival has improved significantly.",
