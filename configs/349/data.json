The survey asked business executives: \"In your principal lines of business in this country, do you have business relationships (for example as a supplier, client, partner or competitor) with companies whose headquarters are located in any of the following countries?\".\n\n \n\nRespondents were presented a list of 28 countries. For each instance where the respondent answered that they do have business relationships with companies headquartered in a country, the respondents were then asked: \"How often do firms headquartered in (country name) engage in bribery in this country?\"\n\n \n\nAnswers were given on a 5-point scale where 1 corresponded to ‘never’ and 5 to ‘always’. This was then converted into a 10-point scale system, where 10 corresponds to ‘never’ and 0 to ‘always’. Since the index reflects views on foreign bribery, assessments of companies from the respondents’ own countries were excluded."
