    "Expenditures associated with international visitors are traditionally categorized under the travel item of the Balance of Payments (BOP). For inbound tourism, these expenses are recorded as \"credits\" in the BOP and referred to as \"travel receipts\".",
    "It's important to note that BOP estimates also include expenditures related to other types of travelers, such as long-term students, patients, border workers, and seasonal workers, which can be substantial in some countries.",
    "In the context of this specific indicator, adjustments have been made to account for inflation and differences in the cost of living in the destination countries where tourists spend their money.",
    "To achieve this, the expenditure data has been converted from US dollars to the local currency of each respective country.",
    "The inflation adjustment is based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the year 2021 specific to each country.",
    "Finally, the data is expressed in international 2021 US dollars, enabling consistent and comparable analysis across different destinations and time periods.",
    "Following the adjustment, in countries where the cost of living is lower, the adjusted total expenditure will reflect a higher value.",
    "This indicates that tourist money holds greater purchasing power in terms of acquiring goods and services, allowing tourists to obtain more with their expenditures in these destinations."
