Traditional biomass for the years 2016 and 2017 have been estimated based on the approximate rate of change in the previous 5 years from Smil data.\n\nData represents primary energy (rather than final energy) consumption. 'Other renewables' represents all renewable sources minus solar, wind, and hydropower (e.g. geothermal, wave and tidal, and modern biofuels).\n"}},"98869":{"years":[1800,1810,1820,1830,1840,1850,1860,1870,1880,1890,1900,1910,1920,1930,1940,1950,1960,1965,1966,1967,1968,1969,1970,1971,1972,1973,1974,1975,1976,1977,1978,1979,1980,1981,1982,1983,1984,1985,1986,1987,1988,1989,1990,1991,1992,1993,1994,1995,1996,1997,1998,1999,2000,2001,2002,2003,2004,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009,2010,2011,2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017],"entities":[355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355],"values":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.000154663,0.000211006,0.000346572,0.002716851,0.003689197,0.004128513,0.004742054,0.005685265,0.007015095,0.007998279,0.00867094,0.011192019,0.01473294,0.019311835,0.027949662,0.033791719,0.045152075,0.052461299,0.068114591,0.080751475,0.100424962,0.125131217,0.160225025,0.203902448,0.241790247,0.30244826,0.358516864,0.435607428,0.477878102,0.555327465,0.633975166,0.730974969],"id":98869,"name":"Wind (%) (Smil & BP)","unit":"","description":null,"createdAt":"2018-11-26T15:01:56.000Z","updatedAt":"2018-11-26T15:19:25.000Z","code":null,"coverage":"","timespan":"","datasetId":3110,"sourceId":16245,"shortUnit":null,"display":{"name":"Wind","unit":"%","shortUnit":"%"},"columnOrder":0,"originalMetadata":null,"datasetName":"Global primary energy share (Smil & BP)","s_id":16245,"s_name":"Global primary energy share (Smil & BP)","source":{"id":16245,"name":"Global primary energy share (Smil & BP)","dataPublishedBy":"Vaclav Smil (2017).
