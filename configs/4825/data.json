(2019) quantify the number and share of vertebrate species that are traded, either locally, nationally or internationally.\n\nThis data is also available, broken down by the share of traded species that are used as pets or as products (such as for meat, medicines, body parts, trophy hunts etc.). Note these shares may sum to more than 100% since many species are traded as both pets and for their products."
