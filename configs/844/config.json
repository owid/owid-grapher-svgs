Basic sanitation facilities include the use of 'improved' facilities that are not shared with other households, which includes flush/pour flush (to piped sewer systems, septic tanks, pit latrines), ventilated improved pit latrines, compositing toilets, and pit latrines with slabs. Safely managed sanitation services are defined as improved facilities not shared with other households and where excreta are safely disposed of in situ or transported and treated offsite.",
