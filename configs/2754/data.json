Child marriage often \ncompromises a girl’s development by resulting in early pregnancy and social isolation, interrupting her \nschooling, limiting her opportunities for career and vocational advancement and placing her at increased \nrisk of intimate partner violence. In many cultures, girls reaching puberty are expected to assume gender \nroles associated with womanhood. These include entering a union and becoming a mother.  \n \nThe practice of early/child marriage is a direct manifestation of gender inequality.  \n \nThe issue of child marriage is addressed in a number of international conventions and agreements. \nAlthough marriage is not mentioned directly in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, child marriage \nis linked to other rights – such as the right to freedom of expression, the right to protection from all \nforms of abuse, and the right to be protected from harmful traditional practices. \n \nConcepts: \n \nBoth formal (i.e., marriages) and informal unions are covered under this indicator. Informal unions are \ngenerally defined as those in which a couple lives together for some time, intends to have a lasting \nrelationship, but for which there has been no formal civil or religious ceremony (i.e., cohabitation). \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nThere are existing tools and mechanisms for data collection that countries have implemented to monitor \nthe situation with regards to this indicator. The modules used to collect information on marital status \namong women and men of reproductive age (15-49 years) in the DHS and MICS have been fully \nharmonized. \n\n\f \n\n \nMethodology \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\n \nComputation Method: \nNumber of women aged 20-24 who were first married or in union before age 15 (or before age 18) \ndivided by the total number of women aged 20-24 in the population multiplied by 100 \n \nDisaggregation: \n \nAge, income, place of residence, geographic location, education, ethnicity (for some countries) \n \nTreatment of missing values: \n \n\n•  At country level \n\n \nWhen data for a country are entirely missing, UNICEF does not publish any country-level estimate \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\n \nThe regional average is applied to those countries within the region with missing values for the \npurposes of calculating regional aggregates only but are not published as country-level estimates. \n\n \nRegional aggregates: \n \nGlobal aggregates are weighted averages of all the sub-regions that make up the world. Regional \naggregates are weighted averages of all the countries within the region. \n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \n \nHousehold surveys such as UNICEF-supported MICS and DHS have been collecting data on this indicator \nin low- and middle-income countries since around the late 1980s. In some countries, such data are also \ncollected through national censuses or other national household surveys. \n \nCollection process: \n \nUNICEF undertakes an annual process to update its global databases, called Country Reporting on \nIndicators for the Goals (CRING). This exercise is done in close collaboration with UNICEF country offices \nwith the purpose of ensuring that UNICEF global databases contain updated and internationally \ncomparable data. UNICEF Country Offices are invited to submit, through an online system, any updated \ndata for a number of key indicators on the well-being of women and children. Updates sent by the \ncountry offices are then reviewed by sector specialists at UNICEF headquarters to check for consistency \nand overall data quality of the submitted estimates. This review is based on a set of objective criteria to \nensure that only the most recent and reliable information is included in the databases. Once reviewed, \nfeedback is made available on whether or not specific data points are accepted, and if not, the reasons \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\nwhy. New data points that are accepted are then entered into UNICEF’s global databases and published \nin the State of the World’s Children statistical tables, as well as in all other data-driven \npublications/material. The updated databases are also posted online at data.unicef.org. \n \nUNICEF also searches throughout the year for additional sources of data that are vetted by the UNICEF \ncountry office before they are included in the global databases. \n \nData Availability \n\n \nComparable data on this indicator are currently available for 124 low- and middle-income countries \n \nCalendar \n\n \nNA \n \nData providers \n\n \nNational Statistical Offices (in most cases) \n \nData compilers \n\n \nUNICEF \n \nReferences \n\n \nURL: \n \ndata.unicef.org \n \nReferences: \n \nhttp://data.unicef.org/child-protection/child-marriage.html \n \n \n \n \n\n\f"
