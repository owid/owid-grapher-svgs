19 July 2016 \n\nGoal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice \nfor all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels \nTarget 16.8: Broaden and strengthen the participation of developing countries in the institutions of global \ngovernance \nIndicator 16.8.1:  Proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in international \norganizations \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \n \nFinancing for Development Office, DESA (FFDO) \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n \nDefinition: \n \nThe indicator Proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in international \norganizations has two components, the developing country proportion of voting rights and the \ndeveloping country proportion of membership in international organisations. In some institutions these \ntwo components are identical. \n \nThe indicator is calculated independently for eleven different international institutions: The United \nNations General Assembly, the United Nations Security Council, the United Nations Economic and Social \nCouncil, the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, \nthe International Finance Corporation, the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the \nInter-American Development Bank, the World Trade Organisation, and the Financial Stability Board. \n \nRationale: \n \nThe UN is based on a principle of sovereign equality of all its Member States (Article 2, UN Charter). This \nindicator aims to measure the degree to which States enjoy equal representation in international \norganizations. \n \nConcepts: \n \nThere is no established convention for the designation of \"developed\" and \"developing\" countries or \nareas in the United Nations system. In common practice, Japan in Asia, Canada and the United States in \nNorthern America, Australia and New Zealand in Oceania, and Europe are considered \"developed\" \nregions or areas. The aggregation across all institutions is currently done according to the United Nations \nM.49 statistical standard which includes designation of “developed regions” and “developing regions”, \nwhile an ongoing review seeks to reach agreement on how to define these terms for the purposes of SDG \nmonitoring. The designations \"developed\" and developing\" are intended for statistical convenience and \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\ndo not necessarily express a judgement about the stage reached by a particular country or area in the \ndevelopment process. \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nCross institutional comparisons needs to pay attention to the different membership of the institutions. \nVoting rights and membership in their institutions are agreed by the Member States themselves. As a \nstructural indicator, there will be only small changes over time to reflect agreement on new States joining \nas Members, suspension of voting rights, membership withdrawal and negotiated voting rights changes. \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \nThe computation uses each institutions’ own published membership and voting rights data from their \nrespective annual reports. The proportion of voting rights is computed as the number of voting rights \nallocated to developing countries, divided by the total number of voting rights. The proportion of \nmembership is calculated by taking the number of developing country members, divided by the total \nnumber of members. \n \nDisaggregation: \n \nData is calculated and presented separately for each international organization. \n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \n \nAnnual reports, as presented on the website of the institution in question, are used as sources of data.

19 July 2016 \n\nGoal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice \nfor all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels \nTarget 16.8: Broaden and strengthen the participation of developing countries in the institutions of global \ngovernance \nIndicator 16.8.1:  Proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in international \norganizations \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \n \nFinancing for Development Office, DESA (FFDO) \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n \nDefinition: \n \nThe indicator Proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in international \norganizations has two components, the developing country proportion of voting rights and the \ndeveloping country proportion of membership in international organisations. In some institutions these \ntwo components are identical. \n \nThe indicator is calculated independently for eleven different international institutions: The United \nNations General Assembly, the United Nations Security Council, the United Nations Economic and Social \nCouncil, the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, \nthe International Finance Corporation, the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the \nInter-American Development Bank, the World Trade Organisation, and the Financial Stability Board. \n \nRationale: \n \nThe UN is based on a principle of sovereign equality of all its Member States (Article 2, UN Charter). This \nindicator aims to measure the degree to which States enjoy equal representation in international \norganizations. \n \nConcepts: \n \nThere is no established convention for the designation of \"developed\" and \"developing\" countries or \nareas in the United Nations system. In common practice, Japan in Asia, Canada and the United States in \nNorthern America, Australia and New Zealand in Oceania, and Europe are considered \"developed\" \nregions or areas. The aggregation across all institutions is currently done according to the United Nations \nM.49 statistical standard which includes designation of “developed regions” and “developing regions”, \nwhile an ongoing review seeks to reach agreement on how to define these terms for the purposes of SDG \nmonitoring. The designations \"developed\" and developing\" are intended for statistical convenience and \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\ndo not necessarily express a judgement about the stage reached by a particular country or area in the \ndevelopment process. \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nCross institutional comparisons needs to pay attention to the different membership of the institutions. \nVoting rights and membership in their institutions are agreed by the Member States themselves. As a \nstructural indicator, there will be only small changes over time to reflect agreement on new States joining \nas Members, suspension of voting rights, membership withdrawal and negotiated voting rights changes. \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \nThe computation uses each institutions’ own published membership and voting rights data from their \nrespective annual reports. The proportion of voting rights is computed as the number of voting rights \nallocated to developing countries, divided by the total number of voting rights. The proportion of \nmembership is calculated by taking the number of developing country members, divided by the total \nnumber of members. \n \nDisaggregation: \n \nData is calculated and presented separately for each international organization. \n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \n \nAnnual reports, as presented on the website of the institution in question, are used as sources of data.

19 July 2016 \n\nGoal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice \nfor all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels \nTarget 16.8: Broaden and strengthen the participation of developing countries in the institutions of global \ngovernance \nIndicator 16.8.1:  Proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in international \norganizations \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \n \nFinancing for Development Office, DESA (FFDO) \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n \nDefinition: \n \nThe indicator Proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in international \norganizations has two components, the developing country proportion of voting rights and the \ndeveloping country proportion of membership in international organisations. In some institutions these \ntwo components are identical. \n \nThe indicator is calculated independently for eleven different international institutions: The United \nNations General Assembly, the United Nations Security Council, the United Nations Economic and Social \nCouncil, the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, \nthe International Finance Corporation, the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the \nInter-American Development Bank, the World Trade Organisation, and the Financial Stability Board. \n \nRationale: \n \nThe UN is based on a principle of sovereign equality of all its Member States (Article 2, UN Charter). This \nindicator aims to measure the degree to which States enjoy equal representation in international \norganizations. \n \nConcepts: \n \nThere is no established convention for the designation of \"developed\" and \"developing\" countries or \nareas in the United Nations system. In common practice, Japan in Asia, Canada and the United States in \nNorthern America, Australia and New Zealand in Oceania, and Europe are considered \"developed\" \nregions or areas. The aggregation across all institutions is currently done according to the United Nations \nM.49 statistical standard which includes designation of “developed regions” and “developing regions”, \nwhile an ongoing review seeks to reach agreement on how to define these terms for the purposes of SDG \nmonitoring. The designations \"developed\" and developing\" are intended for statistical convenience and \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\ndo not necessarily express a judgement about the stage reached by a particular country or area in the \ndevelopment process. \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nCross institutional comparisons needs to pay attention to the different membership of the institutions. \nVoting rights and membership in their institutions are agreed by the Member States themselves. As a \nstructural indicator, there will be only small changes over time to reflect agreement on new States joining \nas Members, suspension of voting rights, membership withdrawal and negotiated voting rights changes. \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \nThe computation uses each institutions’ own published membership and voting rights data from their \nrespective annual reports. The proportion of voting rights is computed as the number of voting rights \nallocated to developing countries, divided by the total number of voting rights. The proportion of \nmembership is calculated by taking the number of developing country members, divided by the total \nnumber of members. \n \nDisaggregation: \n \nData is calculated and presented separately for each international organization. \n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \n \nAnnual reports, as presented on the website of the institution in question, are used as sources of data.

19 July 2016 \n\nGoal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice \nfor all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels \nTarget 16.8: Broaden and strengthen the participation of developing countries in the institutions of global \ngovernance \nIndicator 16.8.1:  Proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in international \norganizations \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \n \nFinancing for Development Office, DESA (FFDO) \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n \nDefinition: \n \nThe indicator Proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in international \norganizations has two components, the developing country proportion of voting rights and the \ndeveloping country proportion of membership in international organisations. In some institutions these \ntwo components are identical. \n \nThe indicator is calculated independently for eleven different international institutions: The United \nNations General Assembly, the United Nations Security Council, the United Nations Economic and Social \nCouncil, the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, \nthe International Finance Corporation, the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the \nInter-American Development Bank, the World Trade Organisation, and the Financial Stability Board. \n \nRationale: \n \nThe UN is based on a principle of sovereign equality of all its Member States (Article 2, UN Charter). This \nindicator aims to measure the degree to which States enjoy equal representation in international \norganizations. \n \nConcepts: \n \nThere is no established convention for the designation of \"developed\" and \"developing\" countries or \nareas in the United Nations system. In common practice, Japan in Asia, Canada and the United States in \nNorthern America, Australia and New Zealand in Oceania, and Europe are considered \"developed\" \nregions or areas. The aggregation across all institutions is currently done according to the United Nations \nM.49 statistical standard which includes designation of “developed regions” and “developing regions”, \nwhile an ongoing review seeks to reach agreement on how to define these terms for the purposes of SDG \nmonitoring. The designations \"developed\" and developing\" are intended for statistical convenience and \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\ndo not necessarily express a judgement about the stage reached by a particular country or area in the \ndevelopment process. \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nCross institutional comparisons needs to pay attention to the different membership of the institutions. \nVoting rights and membership in their institutions are agreed by the Member States themselves. As a \nstructural indicator, there will be only small changes over time to reflect agreement on new States joining \nas Members, suspension of voting rights, membership withdrawal and negotiated voting rights changes. \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \nThe computation uses each institutions’ own published membership and voting rights data from their \nrespective annual reports. The proportion of voting rights is computed as the number of voting rights \nallocated to developing countries, divided by the total number of voting rights. The proportion of \nmembership is calculated by taking the number of developing country members, divided by the total \nnumber of members. \n \nDisaggregation: \n \nData is calculated and presented separately for each international organization. \n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \n \nAnnual reports, as presented on the website of the institution in question, are used as sources of data.

19 July 2016 \n\nGoal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice \nfor all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels \nTarget 16.8: Broaden and strengthen the participation of developing countries in the institutions of global \ngovernance \nIndicator 16.8.1:  Proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in international \norganizations \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \n \nFinancing for Development Office, DESA (FFDO) \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n \nDefinition: \n \nThe indicator Proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in international \norganizations has two components, the developing country proportion of voting rights and the \ndeveloping country proportion of membership in international organisations. In some institutions these \ntwo components are identical. \n \nThe indicator is calculated independently for eleven different international institutions: The United \nNations General Assembly, the United Nations Security Council, the United Nations Economic and Social \nCouncil, the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, \nthe International Finance Corporation, the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the \nInter-American Development Bank, the World Trade Organisation, and the Financial Stability Board. \n \nRationale: \n \nThe UN is based on a principle of sovereign equality of all its Member States (Article 2, UN Charter). This \nindicator aims to measure the degree to which States enjoy equal representation in international \norganizations. \n \nConcepts: \n \nThere is no established convention for the designation of \"developed\" and \"developing\" countries or \nareas in the United Nations system. In common practice, Japan in Asia, Canada and the United States in \nNorthern America, Australia and New Zealand in Oceania, and Europe are considered \"developed\" \nregions or areas. The aggregation across all institutions is currently done according to the United Nations \nM.49 statistical standard which includes designation of “developed regions” and “developing regions”, \nwhile an ongoing review seeks to reach agreement on how to define these terms for the purposes of SDG \nmonitoring. The designations \"developed\" and developing\" are intended for statistical convenience and \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\ndo not necessarily express a judgement about the stage reached by a particular country or area in the \ndevelopment process. \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nCross institutional comparisons needs to pay attention to the different membership of the institutions. \nVoting rights and membership in their institutions are agreed by the Member States themselves. As a \nstructural indicator, there will be only small changes over time to reflect agreement on new States joining \nas Members, suspension of voting rights, membership withdrawal and negotiated voting rights changes. \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \nThe computation uses each institutions’ own published membership and voting rights data from their \nrespective annual reports. The proportion of voting rights is computed as the number of voting rights \nallocated to developing countries, divided by the total number of voting rights. The proportion of \nmembership is calculated by taking the number of developing country members, divided by the total \nnumber of members. \n \nDisaggregation: \n \nData is calculated and presented separately for each international organization. \n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \n \nAnnual reports, as presented on the website of the institution in question, are used as sources of data.

19 July 2016 \n\nGoal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice \nfor all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels \nTarget 16.8: Broaden and strengthen the participation of developing countries in the institutions of global \ngovernance \nIndicator 16.8.1:  Proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in international \norganizations \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \n \nFinancing for Development Office, DESA (FFDO) \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n \nDefinition: \n \nThe indicator Proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in international \norganizations has two components, the developing country proportion of voting rights and the \ndeveloping country proportion of membership in international organisations. In some institutions these \ntwo components are identical. \n \nThe indicator is calculated independently for eleven different international institutions: The United \nNations General Assembly, the United Nations Security Council, the United Nations Economic and Social \nCouncil, the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, \nthe International Finance Corporation, the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the \nInter-American Development Bank, the World Trade Organisation, and the Financial Stability Board. \n \nRationale: \n \nThe UN is based on a principle of sovereign equality of all its Member States (Article 2, UN Charter). This \nindicator aims to measure the degree to which States enjoy equal representation in international \norganizations. \n \nConcepts: \n \nThere is no established convention for the designation of \"developed\" and \"developing\" countries or \nareas in the United Nations system. In common practice, Japan in Asia, Canada and the United States in \nNorthern America, Australia and New Zealand in Oceania, and Europe are considered \"developed\" \nregions or areas. The aggregation across all institutions is currently done according to the United Nations \nM.49 statistical standard which includes designation of “developed regions” and “developing regions”, \nwhile an ongoing review seeks to reach agreement on how to define these terms for the purposes of SDG \nmonitoring. The designations \"developed\" and developing\" are intended for statistical convenience and \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\ndo not necessarily express a judgement about the stage reached by a particular country or area in the \ndevelopment process. \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nCross institutional comparisons needs to pay attention to the different membership of the institutions. \nVoting rights and membership in their institutions are agreed by the Member States themselves. As a \nstructural indicator, there will be only small changes over time to reflect agreement on new States joining \nas Members, suspension of voting rights, membership withdrawal and negotiated voting rights changes. \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \nThe computation uses each institutions’ own published membership and voting rights data from their \nrespective annual reports. The proportion of voting rights is computed as the number of voting rights \nallocated to developing countries, divided by the total number of voting rights. The proportion of \nmembership is calculated by taking the number of developing country members, divided by the total \nnumber of members. \n \nDisaggregation: \n \nData is calculated and presented separately for each international organization. \n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \n \nAnnual reports, as presented on the website of the institution in question, are used as sources of data.

19 July 2016 \n\nGoal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice \nfor all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels \nTarget 16.8: Broaden and strengthen the participation of developing countries in the institutions of global \ngovernance \nIndicator 16.8.1:  Proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in international \norganizations \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \n \nFinancing for Development Office, DESA (FFDO) \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n \nDefinition: \n \nThe indicator Proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in international \norganizations has two components, the developing country proportion of voting rights and the \ndeveloping country proportion of membership in international organisations. In some institutions these \ntwo components are identical. \n \nThe indicator is calculated independently for eleven different international institutions: The United \nNations General Assembly, the United Nations Security Council, the United Nations Economic and Social \nCouncil, the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, \nthe International Finance Corporation, the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the \nInter-American Development Bank, the World Trade Organisation, and the Financial Stability Board. \n \nRationale: \n \nThe UN is based on a principle of sovereign equality of all its Member States (Article 2, UN Charter). This \nindicator aims to measure the degree to which States enjoy equal representation in international \norganizations. \n \nConcepts: \n \nThere is no established convention for the designation of \"developed\" and \"developing\" countries or \nareas in the United Nations system. In common practice, Japan in Asia, Canada and the United States in \nNorthern America, Australia and New Zealand in Oceania, and Europe are considered \"developed\" \nregions or areas. The aggregation across all institutions is currently done according to the United Nations \nM.49 statistical standard which includes designation of “developed regions” and “developing regions”, \nwhile an ongoing review seeks to reach agreement on how to define these terms for the purposes of SDG \nmonitoring. The designations \"developed\" and developing\" are intended for statistical convenience and \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\ndo not necessarily express a judgement about the stage reached by a particular country or area in the \ndevelopment process. \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nCross institutional comparisons needs to pay attention to the different membership of the institutions. \nVoting rights and membership in their institutions are agreed by the Member States themselves. As a \nstructural indicator, there will be only small changes over time to reflect agreement on new States joining \nas Members, suspension of voting rights, membership withdrawal and negotiated voting rights changes. \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \nThe computation uses each institutions’ own published membership and voting rights data from their \nrespective annual reports. The proportion of voting rights is computed as the number of voting rights \nallocated to developing countries, divided by the total number of voting rights. The proportion of \nmembership is calculated by taking the number of developing country members, divided by the total \nnumber of members. \n \nDisaggregation: \n \nData is calculated and presented separately for each international organization. \n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \n \nAnnual reports, as presented on the website of the institution in question, are used as sources of data.

19 July 2016 \n\nGoal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice \nfor all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels \nTarget 16.8: Broaden and strengthen the participation of developing countries in the institutions of global \ngovernance \nIndicator 16.8.1:  Proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in international \norganizations \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \n \nFinancing for Development Office, DESA (FFDO) \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n \nDefinition: \n \nThe indicator Proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in international \norganizations has two components, the developing country proportion of voting rights and the \ndeveloping country proportion of membership in international organisations. In some institutions these \ntwo components are identical. \n \nThe indicator is calculated independently for eleven different international institutions: The United \nNations General Assembly, the United Nations Security Council, the United Nations Economic and Social \nCouncil, the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, \nthe International Finance Corporation, the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the \nInter-American Development Bank, the World Trade Organisation, and the Financial Stability Board. \n \nRationale: \n \nThe UN is based on a principle of sovereign equality of all its Member States (Article 2, UN Charter). This \nindicator aims to measure the degree to which States enjoy equal representation in international \norganizations. \n \nConcepts: \n \nThere is no established convention for the designation of \"developed\" and \"developing\" countries or \nareas in the United Nations system. In common practice, Japan in Asia, Canada and the United States in \nNorthern America, Australia and New Zealand in Oceania, and Europe are considered \"developed\" \nregions or areas. The aggregation across all institutions is currently done according to the United Nations \nM.49 statistical standard which includes designation of “developed regions” and “developing regions”, \nwhile an ongoing review seeks to reach agreement on how to define these terms for the purposes of SDG \nmonitoring. The designations \"developed\" and developing\" are intended for statistical convenience and \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\ndo not necessarily express a judgement about the stage reached by a particular country or area in the \ndevelopment process. \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nCross institutional comparisons needs to pay attention to the different membership of the institutions. \nVoting rights and membership in their institutions are agreed by the Member States themselves. As a \nstructural indicator, there will be only small changes over time to reflect agreement on new States joining \nas Members, suspension of voting rights, membership withdrawal and negotiated voting rights changes. \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \nThe computation uses each institutions’ own published membership and voting rights data from their \nrespective annual reports. The proportion of voting rights is computed as the number of voting rights \nallocated to developing countries, divided by the total number of voting rights. The proportion of \nmembership is calculated by taking the number of developing country members, divided by the total \nnumber of members. \n \nDisaggregation: \n \nData is calculated and presented separately for each international organization. \n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \n \nAnnual reports, as presented on the website of the institution in question, are used as sources of data.

19 July 2016 \n\nGoal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice \nfor all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels \nTarget 16.8: Broaden and strengthen the participation of developing countries in the institutions of global \ngovernance \nIndicator 16.8.1:  Proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in international \norganizations \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \n \nFinancing for Development Office, DESA (FFDO) \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n \nDefinition: \n \nThe indicator Proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in international \norganizations has two components, the developing country proportion of voting rights and the \ndeveloping country proportion of membership in international organisations. In some institutions these \ntwo components are identical. \n \nThe indicator is calculated independently for eleven different international institutions: The United \nNations General Assembly, the United Nations Security Council, the United Nations Economic and Social \nCouncil, the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, \nthe International Finance Corporation, the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the \nInter-American Development Bank, the World Trade Organisation, and the Financial Stability Board. \n \nRationale: \n \nThe UN is based on a principle of sovereign equality of all its Member States (Article 2, UN Charter). This \nindicator aims to measure the degree to which States enjoy equal representation in international \norganizations. \n \nConcepts: \n \nThere is no established convention for the designation of \"developed\" and \"developing\" countries or \nareas in the United Nations system. In common practice, Japan in Asia, Canada and the United States in \nNorthern America, Australia and New Zealand in Oceania, and Europe are considered \"developed\" \nregions or areas. The aggregation across all institutions is currently done according to the United Nations \nM.49 statistical standard which includes designation of “developed regions” and “developing regions”, \nwhile an ongoing review seeks to reach agreement on how to define these terms for the purposes of SDG \nmonitoring. The designations \"developed\" and developing\" are intended for statistical convenience and \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\ndo not necessarily express a judgement about the stage reached by a particular country or area in the \ndevelopment process. \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nCross institutional comparisons needs to pay attention to the different membership of the institutions. \nVoting rights and membership in their institutions are agreed by the Member States themselves. As a \nstructural indicator, there will be only small changes over time to reflect agreement on new States joining \nas Members, suspension of voting rights, membership withdrawal and negotiated voting rights changes. \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \nThe computation uses each institutions’ own published membership and voting rights data from their \nrespective annual reports. The proportion of voting rights is computed as the number of voting rights \nallocated to developing countries, divided by the total number of voting rights. The proportion of \nmembership is calculated by taking the number of developing country members, divided by the total \nnumber of members. \n \nDisaggregation: \n \nData is calculated and presented separately for each international organization. \n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \n \nAnnual reports, as presented on the website of the institution in question, are used as sources of data.
