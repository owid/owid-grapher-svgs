(2018) GPS)","unit":"","description":"Negative reciprocity was measured using three self-assessments. \n\nFirst, respondents were asked if they would exact revenge if treated unjustly, even if doing so comes with a cost (0-10). \n\nThe second and third questions asked about respondents' willingness to punish someone for unfair behavior, either towards themselves or a third person. The third question captures prosocial punishment comparable to norm enforcement. \n\nHigher values indicate the country average for negative reciprocity is above the world average. \n\nThe three items receive roughly equal weights, a third each.

This includes 15 countries from the Americas, 25 from Europe, 22 from Asia and the Pacific, and 14 African countries - 11 of which are Sub-Saharan. In total, this covers 90% of both the world population and total income. \n\nThe median sample size was 1,000 participants per country. The sample includes preference measures for over 80,000 participants altogether. \n\nCountry level averages for each economic preference were calculated using individual-level data weighted by the sampling weights provided by the Gallup World Poll. Each preference is normalized to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 in the individual-level data.\n\nFor more information on the construction of the GPS dataset, see Section II.A of the paper by Falk et al.
