National reporting processes are led by officially designated HFA focal institutions in country, and regional reporting by regional intergovernmental organizations.\n\nHFA's five priorities are:\n1. Making disaster risk reduction a policy priority, institutional strengthening\n2. Risk assessment and early warning systems\n3. Education, information and public awareness\n4. Reducing underlying risk factors\n5. Preparedness for effective response\nStatistical concept and methodology: Resilience is measured by the disaster risk reduction progress score, an average of self-assessment scores submitted by countries under Priority 1 of the Hyogo Framework National Progress Reports.
