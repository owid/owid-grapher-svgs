    "This data is based on the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), which is conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This is an annual, cross-sectional survey that measures how people spend their time and who they spend it with.",
    "The question is phrased as \"Who was with in the room with you?\" or \"Who accompanied you?”. If people are on a phone or video call, they are not counted as being with someone, unless someone else is in the room with them.",
    "We pool the ATUS data from 2010 to 2023 and then calculate averages for each age group.",
    "We have combined some categories for presentation purposes: \"children\" include related and household children under 18, grandchildren and other related children under 18, \"friends\" include roommates or lodgers and \"partner\" includes spouses, boy-/girlfriends, and co-habiting partners.",
    "Time spent with multiple people can be counted more than once (e.g., attending a party with friends and partner counts toward both \"friends\" and \"partner\").",
    "The \"Other\" category includes all other relationships not covered by the other categories, such as neighbors, customers or non-related, non-household children.",
    "Since this is a cross-sectional survey, it queries a new sample from the U.S. population every year. This means that we are actually seeing the result of two underlying trends: the effect of aging on social connections, but also the effect of cohort trends. Different generations have different experiences, preferences and social norms, which are reflected in the data.",
    "All individuals aged 80-84 are included in the \"age 80\" category."
