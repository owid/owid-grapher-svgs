  "description": "The Design phase encompasses the specification, logic design, physical design, along with validation and verification. The specification outlines the intended operation of the chip within its target system. The logic design phase constructs a schematic model featuring interconnected electrical components. The physical design converts this schematic into a tangible layout of these components and their interconnecting wires. Finally, the design undergoes a validation and verification process to ensure its functionality.",

The current version of the dataset reflects how researchers understood this supply chain in early 2021. It uses a wide variety of sources, such as corporate websites and disclosures, specialized market research, and industry group publications.\n\nMost of the data is taken from the CSET report The Semiconductor Supply Chain: Assessing National Competitiveness, published in 2021. In 2022, ETO researchers augmented the company profiles in the data with information manually collected from producer websites and the open internet.\n\nThe data can be accessed here: https://eto.tech/dataset-docs/chipexplorer/"
