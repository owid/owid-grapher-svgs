  "description": "The completion of the fabrication process yields a finished wafer housing numerous chips in a grid pattern. The subsequent stage is Assembly, which involves testing and packaging. The wafer undergoes division into individual chips or 'dies.' Each chip is mounted on a frame, wired to facilitate connection with external devices, and housed within a protective case. This stage results in the familiar image of a rectangular, dark grey chip with metal pins around the periphery. The chip also undergoes testing to confirm its operational capacity.\n\nHistorically, Assembly, Test, and Packaging (ATP) was considered a lower value stage. However, with the exponential rise in transistor densities within logic chips, packaging has progressively become a key determinant of chip performance.",

The current version of the dataset reflects how researchers understood this supply chain in early 2021. It uses a wide variety of sources, such as corporate websites and disclosures, specialized market research, and industry group publications.\n\nMost of the data is taken from the CSET report The Semiconductor Supply Chain: Assessing National Competitiveness, published in 2021. In 2022, ETO researchers augmented the company profiles in the data with information manually collected from producer websites and the open internet.\n\nThe data can be accessed here: https://eto.tech/dataset-docs/chipexplorer/"
