    "additionalInfo": "This study reconstructs historical trends in reef cover of the coral species Acropora in the Caribbean. It is measured by two variables:\n– the percentage of sites where Acropora was dominant\n– the percentage of sites where Acropora was present\n\nTo present this data as a time-series: where timings are given as a range, we have simplified the values into the mid-point year: e.g. 1960-1969 is given as the year 1965."
