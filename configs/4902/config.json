        "content": "Corals contain microscopic algae that photosynthesize, providing corals with the majority of their energy. When exposed to warmer waters, corals can expel their algal symbionts, meaning they lose their source of energy. Without their algae, corals turn pale; causing them to look ‘bleached’. Several successive bleaching events can cause coral to die.",
