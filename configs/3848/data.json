affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. \nTarget 7.a: By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and \ntechnology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel \ntechnology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology. \nIndicator 7.a.1:  International financial flows to developing countries in support of clean energy \nresearch and development and renewable energy production, including in hybrid systems. \n \n\nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and International Renewable Energy \nAgency (IRENA) \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n \nDefinition: \nThe flows are covered through two complementary sources. \n \nOECD: The flows covered by the OECD are defined as all official loans, grants and equity investments \nreceived by countries on the DAC List of ODA Recipients from foreign governments and multilateral \nagencies, for the purpose of clean energy research and development and renewable energy production, \nincluding in hybrid systems extracted from the OECD/DAC Creditor Reporting System (CRS) with the \nfollowing sector codes: \n \n•  23210 Energy generation, renewable sources – multiple technologies - Renewable energy generation \nprogrammes that cannot be attributed to one single technology (codes 23220 through 23280 below). \nFuelwood/charcoal production should be included under forestry 31261.  \n\n•  23220 Hydro-electric power plants - Including energy generating river barges.  \n•  23230 Solar energy - Including photo-voltaic cells, solar thermal applications and solar heating.  \n•  23240 Wind energy - Wind energy for water lifting and electric power generation.  \n•  23250 Marine energy - Including ocean thermal energy conversion, tidal and wave power.  \n•  23260 Geothermal energy - Use of geothermal energy for generating electric power or directly as heat \n\nfor agriculture, etc.  \n\n•  23270- Biofuel-fired power plants Use of solids and liquids produced from biomass for direct power \ngeneration. Also includes biogases from anaerobic fermentation (e.g. landfill gas, sewage sludge gas, \nfermentation of energy crops and manure) and thermal processes (also known as syngas); waste fired \npower plants making use of biodegradable municipal waste (household waste and waste from \ncompanies and public services that resembles household waste, collected at installations specifically \ndesigned for their disposal with recovery of combustible liquids, gases or heat). See code 23360 for \nnon-renewable waste-fired power plants. \n \n\nResearch and development of energy efficiency technologies and measures is captured under CRS sector \ncode 23182 on Energy research. The above flows also include technical assistance provided to support \nproduction, research and development as defined above. \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 12 February 2018 \n\nIRENA: The flows covered by IRENA are defined as all additional loans, grants and equity investments \nreceived by developing countries (defined as countries in developing regions, as listed in the UN M49 \ncomposition of regions) from all foreign governments, multilateral agencies and additional development \nfinance institutions (including export credits, where available) for the purpose of clean energy research \nand development and renewable energy production, including in hybrid systems. These additional flows \ncover the same technologies and other activities (research and development, technical assistance, etc.) \nas listed above and exclude all flows extracted from the OECD/DAC CRS. \n \nRationale: \nTotal ODA and OOF flows to developing countries quantify the public financial effort (excluding export \ncredits) that donors provide to developing countries for renewable energies. The additional flows (from \nthe IRENA database) capture the flows to non-ODA Recipients in developing regions, flows from countries \nand institutions not currently reporting to the DAC and certain other types of flows, such as export \ncredits.  \n \nEnergy access is a major development constraint in many developing countries and, while starting from a \nrelatively low base, energy demand is expected to grow very rapidly in many of these countries in the \nfuture. This presents an opportunity for developing countries to utilize clean and renewable technologies \nto meet their future energy needs if they can gain access to the appropriate technologies and expertise. \nThis indicator provides a suitable measure of the international support given to developing countries to \naccess these technologies. \n \nConcepts: \nThe definition and classification of renewable technologies complies with the UN Standard International \nEnergy Product Classification (SIEC). Definitions of other concepts are given above. \n \nComments and limitations: \nData in the Creditor Reporting System are available from 1973.  However, the data coverage is \nconsidered complete since 1995 for commitments at an activity level and 2002 for disbursements. At \npresent, flows to clean energy research and development are only partially covered by the database and \na few other areas (e.g. off-grid electricity supply, investments in improved cookstove projects) may be \ncovered only partially.  \n \nThe IRENA database currently only covers financial institutions that have invested a total of USD 400 \nmillion or more in renewable energy. The process of continuous improvement of the database includes \nverifying the data against data produced by the multilateral development banks for climate finance \nreporting and by comparing the data with other independent reporting by international development \nfinance agencies. \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \nThe OECD flows are calculated by taking the total official flows (ODA and OOF) from DAC member \ncountries, multilateral organisations and other providers of development assistance to the sectors listed \nabove. The IRENA (additional) flows are calculated by taking the total public investment flows from \nIRENA’s Public Renewable Energy Investment Database and excluding: domestic financial flows; \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 12 February 2018 \n\ninternational flows to countries outside developing regions; and flows reported by OECD (as described \nabove). The flows are measured in current United States Dollars (USD). \n \nDisaggregation: \nData in the CRS contain markers which reflect whether a policy objective is attained through the activity.  \nMeasuring gender equality is included in the CRS. Data from the CRS are reported at the project level and \ncan be disaggregated by type of flow (ODA or OOF), by donor, recipient country, type of finance, type of \naid (project, agriculture sub-sector, etc.). \n \nData in IRENA are stored by country (source and recipient) at the project-level, allowing disaggregation of \nthe data in several dimensions. For example, financial flows can be divided by technologies (i.e. \nbioenergy, geothermal energy, hydropower, ocean energy, solar energy, and wind energy) and sub-\ntechnologies (e.g. onshore and offshore wind), by geography (both at the country and regional level), by \nfinancial instrument and by type of recipient. \n \nTreatment of missing values: \n \n\n•  At country level \n\nNot applicable - there is no imputation of missing values. \n\n \n\n \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\nNot applicable - there is no imputation of missing values to obtain regional or global totals.  \n\nRegional aggregates: \nRegional and global totals are calculated by summing all available data from countries. \n \nSources of discrepancies: \nNeither OECD nor IRENA make estimates of these figures. The data all come from national sources \nreported to OECD or, in the case of IRENA, from officially published statistics. \n \nMethods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level: \nNot applicable. \n \nQuality assurance: \nOECD/DAC data are reported by donors according to the same standards and methodologies (see here: \nhttp://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm). IRENA data are compiled from national sources \nfollowing the United Nations Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics: \nhttps://unstats.un.org/unsd/dnss/gp/fundprinciples.aspx.  \n \nConsultation/validation process with countries for adjustments and estimates \nFor OECD, see: http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm \n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 12 February 2018 \n\nThe OECD/DAC has been collecting data on official and private resource flows from 1960 at an aggregate \nlevel and 1973 at an activity level through the Creditor Reporting System (CRS data are considered \ncomplete from 1995 for commitments at an activity level and 2002 for disbursements). Data are reported \non an annual calendar year basis by statistical reporters in national administrations (aid agencies, \nMinistries of Foreign Affairs or Finance, etc. \n \nIRENA’s data on financial flows from public sources in support of renewable energy are available in \nIRENA’s Public Renewable Energy Investment Database. IRENA collects this data from a wide range of \npublicly available sources, including the databases and annual reports of all of the main development \nfinance institutions and 20 other bilateral and multilateral agencies investing in renewable energy. The \ndatabase is updated annually and (at end-2016) covers public renewable energy investment flowing to 29 \ndeveloped countries and 104 developing countries, for the period 2009-2015. As new publicly-funded \nfinancial institutions start investing in renewable energy, the IRENA database will expand to include these \nnew investors over time. \n \nCollection process: \nSee above. \n \nData Availability \n\n \nDescription: \nThe CRS contains flows to all DAC recipient countries. Global and regional figures are based on the sum of \nODA and OOF flows to the renewable energy projects. \nIRENA currently includes data about renewable energy projects in 29 developed countries and 104 \ndeveloping countries (133 countries overall). \n \nTime series: \nOECD: annual data from 1960 onwards (see above). IRENA: annual data from 2009 onwards. \n \nCalendar \n\n \nData collection: \nData for a year is collected during the following year. \n \nData release: \nOECD DAC data is updated four time a year, with complete and detailed data published at year-end \n(covering the previous year). IRENA investment data is available at year-end (covering the previous year). \n \nData providers \n\n \nSee above. \n \nData compilers \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 12 February 2018 \n\n \nOrganisation for
