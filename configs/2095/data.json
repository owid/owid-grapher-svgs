i.e. \nforest, shrubs, trees, pasture land, crop land, etc. – in order to monitor progress on the mountain target.  \n \nThe index, will provide information on the changes in the vegetation cover and, as such, will provide an \nindication of the status of the conservation of mountain environments. \n \nRationale: \n \nThe scientific mountain community recognizes that there is a direct correlation between the green \ncoverage of mountain areas and their state of health, and as a consequence their capacity of fulfilling \ntheir ecosystem roles. Monitoring mountain vegetation changes over time provides an adequate measure \nof the status of conservation of mountain ecosystems. Monitoring the mountain “Green Cover Index” \nover time can provide information on the forest, woody and vegetal cover in general. For instance, its \nreduction will be generally linked to overgrazing, land clearing, urbanization, forest exploitation, timber \nextraction, fuelwood collection, fire. Its increase will be due to vegetation growth possibly linked to land \nrestoration, reforestation or afforestation programmes. \n \nConcepts: \n \nMountains are defined according to the UNEP-WCMC classification that identifies them according to \naltitude, slope and local elevation range as described by Kapos et al. 2000:  \n \nClass 1: elevation > 4,500 meters \nClass 2: elevation 3,500–4,500 meters \nClass 3: elevation 2,500–3,500 meters \nClass 4: elevation 1,500–2,500 meters and slope > 2 \nClass 5: elevation 1,000–1,500 meters and slope > 5 or local elevation range (LER 7 kilometer radius) > \n300 meters \nClass 6: elevation 300–1,000 meters and local elevation range (7 kilometer radius) > 300 meters \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 11 July 2017 \n\n \nComments and limitations: \n \nThe indicator is based on Collect Earth, the most modern technology available. Its user friendliness and \nsmooth learning curve make it a perfect tool for performing fast, accurate and cost-effective \nassessments. It is free, open source and highly customizable for the specific data collection needs and \nmethodologies. It builds upon very high resolution multi-temporal images from Google Earth and Bing \nMaps and Landsat 7 and 8 datasets from Google Earth Engine. Data and images are stored and globally \navailable for any year from 2000, making possible the monitoring of the change over time.  \n \nThe indicator has a global accuracy of 99%, but at national level for small countries the degree of \naccuracy is lower. This will be improved over time as more countries expand the data collection within \ntheir territory.  \n \nData on mountain coverage are provided by the 2015 FAO/MPS global map of mountains. \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \n \nThe indicator results from the juxtaposition of land cover data extracted from FAO Collect Earth tool and \nthe global map of mountains produced by FAO/MPS in 2015 based on the UNEP-WMCM mountain \nclassification.  \n \nCollect Earth (http://www.openforis.org/tools/collect-earth.html) is a free and open source tool that \nenables data collection through Google Earth for a wide variety of purposes, including: \n\nSupport multi-phase National Forest Inventories \nLand Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) assessments \n\n- \n- \n-  Monitoring agricultural land and urban areas \n-  Validation of existing maps \n- \n-  Quantifying deforestation, reforestation and desertification \n\nCollection of spatially explicit socio-economic data \n\n \nDisaggregation: \n \nThe indicator is disaggregated by mountain elevation class. \n \nRegional aggregates: \n \nThe estimate will generated through a probabilistic sampling approach. The sampling design has been \ndeveloped in order to achieve an uncertainty on the forest and vegetation cover parameters of +-2% at \nglobal level and +-4 at regional level. Remote sensing data systematically collected from 2000 will be used \nto generate annual series from 2000 to 2015. The satellite data will be analysed using Collect Earth. \n \nCollect Earth is a tool that enables data collection through augmented visual interpretation of high \nresolution imagery using Google Earth. In conjunction with Google Earth, Bing Maps and Google Earth \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 11 July 2017 \n\nEngine, users can analyse high and very high resolution satellite imagery and historical trends in \nvegetation. It can be used to collect data at the local, regional and global level and has been successfully \nused by many country partners (Papua New Guinea, Tunisia, Uruguay, others). \n \nMethods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level: \n \nThe indicator results from the juxtaposition of land cover data extracted from FAO Collect Earth tool (that \nwas used to build the Global Forest Survey (GFS) Global Assessment map) and the global map of \nmountains produced by FAO/MPS in 2015 based on the UNEP-WMCM mountain classification.  \n \nMountains are defined according to the UNEP-WCMC classification that identifies them according to \naltitude, slope and local elevation range as described by Kapos et al. 2000:  \nClass 1: elevation > 4,500 meters \nClass 2: elevation 3,500–4,500 meters \nClass 3: elevation 2,500–3,500 meters \nClass 4: elevation 1,500–2,500 meters and slope > 2 \nClass 5: elevation 1,000–1,500 meters and slope > 5 or local elevation range (LER 7 kilometer radius) > \n300 meters \nClass 6: elevation 300–1,000 meters and local elevation range (7 kilometer radius) > 300 meters  \nhttp://www.fao.org/mountain-partnership/our-work/focusareas/foodsecurity/en/g  \n \nCollect Earth (http://www.openforis.org/tools/collect-earth.html) is a free and open source tool that \nenables data collection through Google Earth for a wide variety of purposes, including Land Use, Land Use \nChange and Forestry (LULUCF) assessments. The Global Forest Survey (GFS) Global Assessment built on \nthe visual interpretation of satellite images in publicly available repositories, such as Google Earth Engine \nand Bing Maps, to provide a map of land cover/land use data. \n \nLand cover data are classified according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \nscheme, which defines six main classes: Forest land; Cropland; Grassland; Wetlands; Settlements; Other \nLand. Each plot is classified according to the dominant land cover.  \n(http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/4_Volume4/V4_03_Ch3_Representation.pdf)   \n \nThe baseline statistics for the Mountain Green Cover Index are based on the GFS Global Assessment map \nreleased in January 2017. Green cover includes forest land, grassland/shrubland and cropland. The \namounts of land in square kilometers covered by each of these three IPCC land cover/land use classes are \naggregated to calculate the size of the total mountain area that they cover in each country. This figure is \nthen expressed as a ratio of the total mountain area and converted to a percentage, providing the value \nof the Mountain Green Cover Index of each country. This percentage is the value displayed in the SDGs \nglobal database. \n \nQuality assurance: \n \nThe GFS Global Assessment was carried out with standard protocols applied to the entire area of interest. \nDocuments on the system tools and survey can be accessed at:   \n \nhttp://openforis.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Collect_Earth_Tutorials/Collect_Earth_User_Manual_20150\n618_highres_full.pdf \n \nhttp://www.fao.org/in-action/global-forest-survey/en/ \n \nData for all countries have been produced by FAO/MPS and are in the process of being distributed to \ngovernments for their validation.   \n \n\n\fLast updated: 11 July 2017 \n\n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \n \nThe source of data is FAO Collect Earth. \n \nCollection process: \n \nThe estimate will be generated through regional assessment carried out by circa 30 partners all around \nthe world. The data will be collected in with the same methodology in order to guarantee data \nconsistency. The methodology enables intensification of the sampling in order to obtain same level of \nuncertainties at regional and sub regional levels.
