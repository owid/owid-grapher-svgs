promote well-being for all at all ages \nTarget 3.8: Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality \nessential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and \nvaccines for all \nIndicator 3.8.2: Proportion of population with large household expenditure on health as a share of total \nhousehold expenditure or income \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization: \nWorld Health Organization (WHO) \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n \nDefinition: \nProportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of total household \nexpenditure or income.  \n \nTwo thresholds are used to define “large household expenditure on health”: greater than 10% and \ngreater than 25% of total household expenditure or income. \n  \nRationale: \nTarget 3.8 is defined as “Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to \nquality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential \nmedicines and vaccines for all”.  The concern is with all people and communities receiving the quality \nhealth services they need (including medicines and other health products), without financial hardship. \nTwo indicators have been chosen to monitor target 3.8 within the SDG framework. Indicator 3.8.1 is for \nhealth service coverage, which is operationalized with an index that combines 16 health service coverage \nindicators for reproductive, maternal and child health, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, \nand service capacity and access into a single summary metric. Indicator 3.8.2 focuses on health \nexpenditures in relation to a household’s budget to identify financial hardship caused by direct health \ncare payments. Taken together, indicators 3.8.1 and 3.8.2 are meant to capture the service coverage and \nfinancial protection dimensions, respectively, of target 3.8. These two indicators should be always \nmonitored jointly. \n \nIndicator 3.8.2 derives from methodologies dating back to the 1990s developed in collaboration with \nacademics at the World Bank and the World Health Organization. Indicator 3.8.2 is about identifying \npeople that need to devote a substantial share of their total household expenditure or income to health \ncare. The focus is on payments made at the point of use to get any type of treatment, from any type of \nprovider, for any type of disease or health problem, net of any reimbursements to the individual who \nmade the payment but excluding pre-payments for health services; for example, in the form of taxes or \nspecific insurance premiums or contributions. Such direct payments are the least equitable way to \nfinance the health systems given that they determine the extent of care received.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: March 2019 \n\nThis is clearly against the spirit of the target, which calls for granting access based on health needs not a \nhousehold’s capacity to pull together all its financial resources to meet the health needs of its members. \nSome direct payments might be needed but indicator 3.8.2 is underpinned by the conviction that no one, \nat whatever income level, should have to choose between spending on health and spending on other \nbasic goods and services such as education tuitions, food necessities, housing and utilities. One way of \nassessing the extent to which health systems lead to financial hardship is to calculate the proportion of \nthe population with large household expenditures on health as a share of household total consumption \nor income.  For detailed information on the definition chosen to monitor the financial protection \ndimension of universal health coverage within the SDG monitoring framework (indicator 3.8.2) please \nconsult   Wagstaff et al. (2018) and chapter 2 in the WHO and World Bank report on “Tracking universal \nhealth coverage: 2017 global monitoring report”. \n \nConcepts: \n \nIndicator 3.8.2 is defined as the “Proportion of the population with large household expenditure on \nhealth as a share of total household expenditure or income”. In effect it is based on a ratio exceeding a \nthreshold. The two main concepts of interest behind this ratio are household expenditure on health \n(numerator) and total household consumption expenditure or, when unavailable, income (denominator).  \n \nNumerator \nHousehold expenditure on health is defined as any expenditure incurred at the time of service use to get \nany type of care (promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative, palliative or long-term care) including all \nmedicines, vaccines and other pharmaceutical preparations as well as all health products, from any type \nof provider and for all members of the household. These health expenditures are characterized by a direct \npayments that are financed by a household’s income (including remittances), savings or loans but do not \ninclude any third-party payer reimbursement. As such they only grant access to the health services and \nhealth products individuals can pay for, without any solidarity between the healthy and the sick beyond \nthe household1 and solely based on the willingness and ability of the household to pay. Direct health care \npayments are labelled Out-Of-Pocket (OOP) payments in the classification of health care financing \nschemes (HF) of the international Classification for Health Accounts (ICHA). OOP health expenditures are \nthe most unequitable source of funding for the health system.   \n \nThe components of a household’s health care consumption expenditure so defined should be consistent \nwith division 06 on health of the UN Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose \n(COICOP) which currently  includes expenditures on medicines and medical products (06.1), outpatient \ncare services (06.2) and inpatient care services (06.3) but is being expanded2. \n \nFurther information on definitions and classifications (for example by provider, by beneficiary \ncharacteristics) of health expenditures should be consistent with the international classification for health \naccounts and its family of classifications. ICHA results from collaboration between OECD, Eurostat and the \nWorld Health Organization.   \n \n\n                                                           \n1 http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/a-system-of-health-accounts/classification-of-health-care-\nfinancing-schemes-icha-hf_9789264116016-9-en   \n2 Agenda item 3(l) available at https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/49th-session/documents/; \nhttp://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcs.asp?Cl=5&Lg=1&Co=06.1  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: March 2019 \n\nDenominator \nExpenditure on household consumption and household income are both monetary welfare measures. \nHousehold consumption is a function of permanent income, which is a measure of a household’s long-\nterm economic resources that determine living standards. Consumption is generally defined as the sum \nof the monetary values of all items (goods and services) consumed by the household on domestic \naccount during a reference period. It includes the imputed values of goods and services that are not \npurchased but procured otherwise for consumption. Information on household consumption is usually \ncollected in household surveys that may use different approaches to measure ‘consumption’ depending \non whether items refer to durable or non-durable goods and/or are directly produced by households. \n \nThe most relevant measure of income is disposable income as it is close to the maximum available to the \nhousehold for consumption expenditure during the accounting period. Disposable income is defined as \ntotal income less direct taxes (net of refunds), compulsory fees and fines. Total income is generally \ncomposed of income from employment, property income, income from household production of services \nfor own consumption, transfers received in cash and goods, transfers received as services3.  \n \nIncome is more difficult to measure accurately due to its greater variability over time. Consumption is less \nvariable over time and easier to measure. It is therefore recommended that whenever there is \ninformation on both household consumption and income the former is used (see the “comments and \nlimitations” section to learn more about the sensitivity of 3.8.2 to the income/expenditure choice in the \ndenominator). Statistics on 3.8.2 currently produced by WHO and the World Bank predominantly rely on \nconsumption (see section on data sources).  \n \nThresholds \nIt is recommended to use two thresholds for global reporting to identify large household expenditure on \nhealth as share of total household consumption or income: a lower threshold of 10% (3.8.2_10) and a \nhigher threshold of 25% (3.8.2_25). With these two thresholds the indicator measures financial hardship  \n (see section on comments and limitations).     \n \nComments and limitations: \nIt is feasible to monitor indicator 3.8.2 on a regular basis using the same household survey data that is \nused to monitor SDG target 1.1 and 1.2 on poverty4. These surveys are also regularly conducted for other \npurposes such as calculating weights for the Consumer Price Index. These surveys are conducted typically \nby NSOs. Thus, monitoring the proportion of the population with large household expenditures on health \nas a share of total household consumption or income does not add any additional data collection burden \nso long as the health expenditure component of the household non-food consumption data can be \nidentified. While this is an advantage, indicator 3.8.2 suffers from the same challenges of timeliness, \nfrequency, data quality and comparability of surveys than SDG indicator 1.1.1.  However, indicator 3.8.2 \nhas its own conceptual and empirical limitations. \n \nFirst, indicator 3.8.2 attempts to identify financial hardship that individuals face when using their income, \nsavings or taking loans to pay for health care. However, most household surveys fail to identify the source \nof funding used by a household who is reporting health expenditure. In countries where there is no \nretrospective reimbursement of household spending on health this is not a problem. If a household does \n\n                                                           \n3 http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/download/17thicls/r2hies.pdf   \n4 http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-01-01a.pdf   \n\n \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: March 2019 \n\nreport any expenditure on health, it would be because it is not going to be reimbursed by any third-party \npayer. It is therefore consistent with the definition given for direct health care payments (the numerator).  \nFor those countries on the other hand where there is retrospective reimbursement – for example, via a \ncontributory health insurance scheme - the amount reported by a household on health expenditures \nmight be totally or partially reimbursed at some later point, perhaps outside the recall period of the \nhousehold survey.  \n \nClearly, more work is needed to ensure that survey instruments gather information on the sources of \nfunding used by the household to pay for health care, or the household survey instrument always \nspecifies that health expenditures should be net of any reimbursement.  \n \nSecond, in the current definition of indicator 3.8.2 large health expenditures can be identified by \ncomparing how much household spend on health to either household income or total household \nexpenditure. Expenditure is the recommended measure of household’s resources (see concept section) \nbut recent empirical work has demonstrated that while statistics on 3.8.2 at country level are fairly \nrobust to such choice, their disaggregation by income group is pretty sensitive to it. Income based \nmeasures show a greater concentration  of the proportion of the population with large household \nexpenditure on health among the poor than expenditure based measures (see chapter 2 in  the WHO and \nWorld Bank 2017 report on tracking universal health coverage   as well as Wagstaff et al 2018) . \n \nThird, indicator 3.8.2. relies on a single cut-off point to identify what constitutes ‘large health expenditure \nas a share of total household expenditure or income’. People just below such threshold are not taken into \naccount, which is always the problem with measures based on cut-offs. This is simply avoided by plotting \nthe cumulative distribution function of the health expenditure ratio behind 3.8.2. By doing so, it is \npossible to identify for any threshold the proportion of the population that is devoting any share of its \nhousehold’s budget to health.  \n \nFourth, indicator 3.8.2. is based on measures of ex-post spending on health care. Low levels of spending \ncould be driven by measurement errors due to both non-sampling errors such as a very short recall \nperiod that does not allow the collection of information on health care requiring an overnight stay; or \nsampling errors such as over-sample of areas with a particularly low burden of disease. No spending \ncould also be due to people not being able to spend anything on health which, at least for the services \nthat are included in 3.8.1, should result in low levels of coverage.  \n \nThere are other indicators used to measure financial hardship. WHO uses  a framework  which includes , \nin addition to indicator 3.8.2, a definition of large health expenditure in relation to non-subsistence \nspending5,6,7,. \n\n                                                           \n5 Chapter 2 in “Tracking universal health coverage: 2017 global monitoring report”, World Health Organization and \nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development/  The World Bank; 2017; \nhttp://www.who.int/healthinfo/indicators/2015/en/ ;  \n6Xu, K., Evans, D.

For more information about the methodology please refer to Wagstaff et al (2018) \nand chapter 2 in the WHO and World Bank 2017 report on tracking universal health coverage. \n \nDisaggregation: \n \nThe following disaggregation is possible in so far as the survey has been designed to provide \nrepresentative estimates at such level: \n\n•  Gender and age of the head of the household \n•  Geographic location (rural/urban) \n•  Quintiles of the household welfare measures (total household expenditure or income). See \n\ncomments and limitations for the sensitivity of the disaggregation to the choice of the welfare \nmeasure. \n \n\nTreatment of missing values: \nAt the country level no imputation is attempted to produce estimates. The proportion of the population \nwith large household expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure or income is \nestimated for all years for which a nationally representative survey on household budget, household \nincome and expenditure, socio-economic conditions or living standards is available with information on \nboth total household expenditure or income and total household expenditure on health. When there are \nmultiple surveys over time for the same country a preference is given to estimates produced based on \nthe same survey. A series of tests is performed to retain the best performing series (see collection \nprocess). \n \nRegional aggregates: \nTo construct regional and global level estimates, when survey-based estimates are not available for the \nreference years of 2000, 2005 or 2010 all survey-based estimates within a 5 year window of the reference \nyear are “lined-up” by using a combination of interpolation, extrapolation, econometric modelling and \nimputation based on regional medians ( Wagstaff et al.,2018; chapter 2 of the 2017 WHO and World Bank \nreport on tracking universal health care coverage). \n \nThe World Bank and the World Health Organization use their own regional grouping, in addition to the \nregional breakdown proposed for the SDG by UNSD.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nLast updated: March 2019 \n\nSources of discrepancies: \nCountry level estimates are all based on nationally representative surveys with information on both \nhousehold total expenditure or income and household expenditure on health (see data sources). In most \ncases such data come from non-standard household surveys and  ex-post standardization processes can \nbe designed to increase the degree of comparability across countries. For instance, regional teams from \nthe World Bank produce standardized versions of raw datasets following common regional procedures: \nthe ECAPOV harmonized datasets are based  on the Living Standards Measurement Study datasets – \nLSMS8  or household budget surveys (HBS) collected in the World Bank’s Europe and Central Asia region; \nthe SHIP collection results from a poverty program on harmonized household surveys in the World Bank’s \nAfrican region, while the SHES collection was developed by the World Bank for the international \ncomparison program9. The Luxembourg income study (LIS) datasets results from effort to harmonize \ndatasets from many high and middle-income countries10.  \n \nIn some cases the raw data is accessible to produce country level estimates. In some countries in addition \nto the raw data a standardized version of it is available and in other countries only the standardized \nversion is. When multiple versions of the same survey are available the best performing in terms of a \nseries of quality assurance tests is retained (see collection process). When a standardized version of a \nnationally designed survey instruments is chosen there are differences between expenditure variables \ngenerated using the raw data, and the expenditure variables generated using the harmonization \nprocedures which might result in different estimated incidence of the population with large household \nexpenditure on health as a share of household total expenditure or income. \n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \nThe recommended data sources for the monitoring of the “Proportion of the population with large \nhousehold expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure or income” are household \nsurveys with information on both household consumption expenditure on health and total household \nconsumption expenditures, which are routinely conducted by national statistical offices. Household \nbudget surveys (HBS) and household income and expenditure surveys (HIES) typically collect these as \nthey are primarily conducted to provide inputs to the calculation of consumer price indices or the \ncompilation of national accounts. Another potential source of information is socio-economic or living \nstandards surveys; however, some of these surveys may not collect information on total household \nconsumption expenditures – for example, when a country measures poverty using income as the welfare \nmeasure11. The most important criterion for selecting a data source to measure SDG indicator 3.8.2 is the \navailability of both household consumption expenditure on health and total household consumption \nexpenditures. \n \n\n                                                           \n8 \nhttp://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/EXTLSMS/0,,contentMDK:21610833~pagePK:64168\n427~piPK:64168435~theSitePK:3358997,00.html \n9 A detailed documentation describing the harmonization procedures is available from the accompanying pdf documents \n10 http://www.lisdatacenter.org/ \n11 http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-01-01a.pdf \n\n \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: March 2019 \n\nWhen socio-economic or living standards surveys are used to measure SDG indicator 3.8.2, any challenge \nfor cross-country comparability of SDG Indicator 1.1.1 also applies to the monitoring of SDG indicator \n3.8.2.  For any type of household survey, given the focus on household health expenditure there is a need \nto improve the current survey instruments for cross-country comparability. The World Health \nOrganization is collaborating with different UN agencies and other important stakeholder to ensure this \nhappens12. \n \nCollection process: \nWHO obtains household survey data from national statistical offices where the denominator and \nnumerator of the health expenditure ratio is constructed following their own guidelines either directly by \nthem or by WHO consultants. WHO works through its regional offices or country offices to obtain access \nto data. No systematic adjustment is undertaken.  \nThe World Bank also typically receives data from National Statistical Offices (NSOs) directly. In other \ncases it uses NSO data received indirectly. For example, it receives data from Eurostat and from LIS \n(Luxembourg Income Study), who provide the World Bank NSO data they have received / harmonized. \nThe Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Argentina and the World Bank jointly maintain the SEDLAC (Socio-\nEconomic Database for Latin American and Caribbean) database that includes harmonized statistics on \npoverty and other distributional and social variables from 24 Latin American and Caribbean countries, \nbased on microdata from household surveys conducted by NSOs. Data is obtained through country \nspecific programs, including technical assistance programs and joint analytical and capacity building \nactivities. The World Bank has relationships with NSOs on work programs involving statistical systems and \ndata analysis. Poverty economists from the World Bank typically engage with NSOs broadly on poverty \nmeasurement and analysis as part of technical assistance activities.   \n \nThe World Health Organization and the World Bank generate indicator 3.8.2 following the same approach \n(see methodology). Both institutions combine estimates at the meso-level. Eligibility of the estimates \nincluded in a joint global database for the production of regional and global estimates is based on the \nfollowing quality checks: \n \nFor the denominator of the health expenditure ratio \n\n•  Compare the logarithm of  total per capita consumption in a benchmark source with the \n\nlogarithm of total per capita consumption estimated from the survey.  Both are expressed on a \nmonthly basis in 2011 international (PPP) $. The benchmark source is taken from Povcalnet13 if \navailable, and otherwise from the World Development Indicators (WDI)14, computed as the \nhousehold final consumption expenditures in constant 2011 international divided by total \npopulation. When the difference between the logarithm of total per capita consumption in the \nbenchmark source and the logarithm of the value estimated from the survey as a share of the \nlogarithm of total per capita consumption in the benchmark is greater than 10% when the \ncomparison is with PovcalNet and greater than 15% when the comparison is made with the WDI \nthe survey point is identified as an outlier internationally in terms of consumption per capita.  \n•  Compare the poverty headcount estimated from the survey at the $1.90 a day poverty line in \n\n2011 PPPs with the poverty incidence reported in PovcalNet  at the same poverty line \n\n                                                           \n12 One example is the WHO engagement in the ongoing revision of COICOP by UNSD  \nhttps://unstats.un.org/unsd/class/revisions/coicop_revision.asp . Another example is a BMGF project WHO is supporting  \nto improve the measurement of household health expenditures  http://www.indepth-network.org/projects/ihope       \n13 http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/povOnDemand.aspx  \n14 https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: March 2019 \n\n(benchmark value). When the absolute difference between the benchmark value   and the survey \nestimate exceeds 10 percentage points the survey point is identified as an outlier in the \nincidence of extreme poverty and flagged for possible exclusion.  \n\n•  Compare the poverty headcount estimated from the survey at the $3.10 a day poverty line in \n\n2011 PPPs with the poverty incidence reported in PovcalNet at the same poverty line \n(benchmark value). When the absolute difference between the benchmark value   and the survey \nestimate exceeds 10 percentage points the survey point is identified as an outlier in poverty \nheadcount at $3.10 a day and flagged for possible exclusion. \n\n \nFor the numerator of the health expenditure ratio \n\n•  Compare the average health expenditure ratio in the survey to a benchmark average budget \n\nshare constructed as the ratio of the aggregate measure of household out-of-pocket \nexpenditures in current local currency and aggregate household final consumption expenditure \nin current local currency.  When the absolute difference exceeds 5 percentage points the survey \npoint is identified as an outlier in terms of household budget share spent on health and flagged \nfor possible exclusion. The macro-indicator of household out-of-pocket expenditures is available \nfrom the Global Health Expenditure Database (GHED)15 and the World Development Indicators \nDatabase (WDI)16. Information on household final consumption expenditure is also extracted \nfrom WDI (series code: NE.CON.PRVT.CN). \n \n\nThese benchmarks are also used to decide between two estimates for those countries and those years for \nwhich both institutions have the same data source. For more information please refer to WHO and World \nBank 2017 report on tracking universal health coverage   as well as Wagstaff  et al 2018.  \nAt the end of the quality assurance process, WHO and the World Bank assemble non-duplicated \nestimates of the proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of \ntotal household expenditure or income for each country. The World Health Organization then undertakes \na country consultation process. Following a WHO Executive Board resolution (EB107.R8) WHO is \nrequested to do this before publishing estimates at country level on behalf of member states. For any \ngiven indicator, this process starts with WHO sending a formal request to ministries of health to \nnominate a focal point for the consultation on the indicator. Once member states nominate focal points, \nWHO then sends draft estimates and methodological descriptions to them. STATA codes are available to \nreproduce the estimates shared. The focal points then send to WHO their comments, often including new \ndata or revised country estimates that are used to update the country estimates. During the 2017 country \nconsultation 137 WHO Member States nominated focal points, 100 of these received draft estimates and \ninformation on the methodology; 37 received only information on methodology as no draft estimate was \nproduced. Of the 57 WHO Member States without focal points nominated estimates are available for 32 \nof them. \n \nIn addition to such consultation, the World Health Organization and the World Bank regularly undertake \ntraining events on the measurement of lack of financial protection coverage, which involves participants \nfrom the Ministry of Health as well as from the National Statistical Office. WHO has several regional and \nnational collaborations ongoing to support the production of indicator 3.8.2 as it has been recently \nadopted it is not yet routinely produced by National Statistical Office despite the data being available and \nthe methodology simple.  Results of such collaborations are not yet included in the database assembled \n\n                                                           \n15 http://www.who.int/health-accounts/ghed/en/  \n16 https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nLast updated: March 2019 \n\nby WHO and the World Bank but estimates produced by a country will be subject to the same quality \nassurance process just described. \n \nData Availability \n\nThis indicator relies primarily on the same data sources that are used to monitor SDG indicator 1.1.1 with \nthe additional requirement of the availability of information regarding health expenditures. Taking this \ninto account, the World Bank and WHO have identified 1566 potentially suitable household survey \ndatasets from 155 countries. Some of these surveys were excluded because they were either \ninaccessible, lacked key variables required for the estimation of the proportion of the population with \nlarge household expenditures on health as a share of total household expenditure or income, they did \nnot pass the quality assurance process or were not part of a consistent time series.  As of December 2017 \na total of 553 datapoints from 132 countries or territories spanning the period 1984-2015 have been used \nto produce SDG indicator 3.8.2 .     \nData availability measured in terms of the number of countries that WHO and the World Bank have \ncurrently reviewed and retained for the estimation of the “proportion of the population with large \nhousehold expenditures on health as a share of total household expenditure or income” is as follows for \nthe most recent year: \n\nSDG regional breakdown \n\n2005 or earlier \n\n2006-2015 \n\nRetained by WHO and the World Bank for the estimation of \nthe \"proportion of the population with large household \nexpenditure on health as a share of total household \nexpenditure or income\" \n\n \nNumber \nof WHO \nMember \nStates \n\n  \n\n44 \n\n33 \n\n14 \n\n16 \n\n23 \n\n48 \n\n2 \n\n14 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n0 \n\n2 \n\n4 \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n16 \n\n(nb of \nMS) \n\n(nb of \nMS) \n\n(nb of \nMS) \n\nTotal  per SDG \nregion \n\n(% by \nregion) \n\n75.00% \n\n30.30% \n\n78.60% \n\n62.50% \n\n39.10% \n\n43.80% \n\n50.00% \n\n0.00% \n\n39 \n\n17 \n\n11 \n\n12 \n\n13 \n\n37 \n\n1 \n\n1 \n\n(% by \nregion) \n\n88.60% \n\n51.50% \n\n78.60% \n\n75.00% \n\n56.50% \n\n77.10% \n\n50.00% \n\n7.10% \n\n(% by \nregion) \n\n13.60% \n\n21.20% \n\n0.00% \n\n12.50% \n\n17.40% \n\n33.30% \n\n0.00% \n\n7.10% \n\n33 \n\n10 \n\n11 \n\n10 \n\n9 \n\n21 \n\n1 \n\n0 \n\nNorthern America (M49) and Europe (M49) \n\nLatin America and the Caribbean (MDG=M49) \n\nCentral Asia (M49) and Southern Asia \n(MDG=M49) \nEastern Asia (M49) and South-eastern Asia \n(MDG=M49) \n\nWestern Asia (M49) and Northern Africa (M49) \n\nSub-Saharan Africa (M49) \n\nAustralia and New Zealand (M49) \n\nOceania (M49) excluding Australia and New \nZealand (M49) \n\n194 \n\n36 \n\n18.60% \n\n95 \n\n49.00% \n\n131 \n\n67.50% \n\n \nOverall data availability covers at least 50% of all WHO member States in all M49 regions except for those \nin Oceania (7.1%).
