It is derived by adding up the surface area in a country of those \n\ntransboundary surface water catchments and transboundary aquifers (i.e. ‘transboundary’ basins) that \n\nare covered by an operational arrangement and dividing the obtained area by the aggregate total area in \n\na country of all transboundary basins (both catchments and aquifers). The result is multiplied by 100 to \n\nobtain it expressed as percentage share. \n\nRationale: \n\nMost of the world’s water resources are shared: 592 transboundary aquifers have been identified and \n\ntransboundary lake and river basins cover nearly one half of the Earth’s land surface and account for an \n\nestimated 60% of global freshwater. Approximately 40% of the world’s population lives in river and lake \n\nbasins shared by two or more countries and over 90% lives in countries that share basins. Development \n\nof water resources has impacts across transboundary basins, potentially on co-riparian countries, and use \n\nof surface water or groundwater may affect the other resource, these usually being interlinked. Intensive \n\nwater use, flow regulation or pollution risks going as far as compromising co-riparian countries’ \n\ndevelopment aspirations and therefore transboundary cooperation is required. However, cooperation is \n\nin most cases not advanced.  \n\nSpecific agreements or other arrangements concluded between co-riparian countries are a key \n\nprecondition to ensure long-term, sustainable cooperation. International customary water law (as \n\nreflected in the Convention on the Law of the Non-navigational Uses of International Watercourses (New \n\nYork, 1997), the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International \n\nLakes (Helsinki, 1992), and the draft Articles on The Law of Transboundary Aquifers (2008; UN General \n\nAssembly resolutions 63/124, 66/104, and 68/118)), as well as existing experience and good practices, all \n\npoint to minimum requirements for operational cooperation. These minimum requirements are captured \n\nby the four criteria for operationality. \n\n\fLast updated: 18 November 2016 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThis is the basis for the explicit call for transboundary water cooperation in the wording of target 6.5 and \n\nthe importance of monitoring this indicator to complement indicator 6.5.1 which measures the \n\nadvancement of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM). \n\nProgress by a particular country towards the cooperation aspect of target 6.5, reflected by the value of \n\nindicator 6.5.2, can be achieved either by establishing new operational cooperation arrangements with \n\nco-riparian countries, or making existing arrangements operational by developing and regularizing \n\nactivities, or expanding the coverage of cooperation arrangements with the ultimate objective to cover \n\nall surface waters and groundwaters. \n\nConcepts: \n\n\"The proposed monitoring has as basis the spatial coverage of transboundary basins shared by each \n\ncountry, and focuses on monitoring whether these are covered by cooperation arrangements that are \n\noperational. The criteria needing to be met for the cooperation on a specific basin being considered \n\n“operational” seeks to capture whether the arrangement(s) indeed provide an adequate basis for \n\ncooperation in water management.  \n\nTransboundary basins are basins of transboundary waters, that is, of any surface waters (notably rivers, \n\nlakes) or groundwaters which mark, cross or are located on boundaries between by two or more states. \n\nFor the purpose of the calculation of this indicator, for surface waters, the basin is the extent of the \n\ncatchment area; for groundwater, the area considered is the extent of the aquifer.  \n\nArrangement for water cooperation: a bilateral or multilateral treaty, convention, agreement or other \n\nformal arrangement, such as memorandum of understanding) between riparian countries that provides a \n\nframework for cooperation on transboundary water management. Agreements or other kind of formal \n\narrangements may be interstate, intergovernmental, interministerial, interagency or between regional \n\nauthorities.  \n\nOperational: For an agreement or other kind of formal arrangement (e.g. a memorandum of \n\nunderstanding) for cooperation between the riparian countries to be considered operational, all the \n\nfollowing criteria needs to be fulfilled:  \n\n- There is a joint body, joint mechanism or commission (e.g. a river basin organization) for transboundary \n\ncooperation  \n\n- There are regular formal communications between riparian countries in form of meetings  \n\n- There is a joint or coordinated water management plan(s), or joint objectives have been set \n\n- There is a regular exchange of data and information. \n\nComments and limitations: \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLast updated: 18 November 2016 \n\nThe spatial information on transboundary surface water basins’ boundaries and the extents of the \n\ncatchment areas are commonly available and essentially static; consequently, once determined, no \n\nupdating need is expected. \n\nThe information on the areal extent of transboundary aquifers may evolve over time as such information \n\nis generally more coarse but likely to improve because of the evolving knowledge on aquifers. Technical \n\nstudies and exchange of information will improve the delineation and might also lead to the identification \n\nof additional transboundary aquifers. \n\nIn situations where more than two riparian countries share a basin, but only some of them have \n\noperational cooperation arrangements, the indicator value may mask the gap that a riparian country \n\ndoes not have cooperation arrangements with both its upstream and downstream neighbours. Such \n\ncomplementary information can be obtained by aggregating data at the level of the basins but not from \n\nthe reporting at the national level.  \n\nThe legal basis for cooperation develops slowly: conclusion of new agreements on transboundary waters \n\nis commonly a long process that takes many years.  \n\nThe operationality of cooperation is more dynamic as it evolves with the expansion of cooperation. The \n\noperationality can be expected to evolve over shorter time frames, and in a year or two, progress could \n\npotentially be observed. \n\n \nMethodology \n\nComputation Method: \n\nStep 1 Identify the transboundary surface waters and aquifers \n\nWhile the identification of transboundary surface water is straightforward, the identification of \n\ntransboundary aquifers requires investigations. \n\nIf there are no transboundary surface waters or groundwaters, reporting is not applicable. \n\nStep 2 Calculate the surface area of each transboundary basin and the total sum \n\nCommonly at least the basins of the rivers and lakes have been delineated through topographic maps and \n\nthe basin area is known or easily measurable.  \n\nThe total transboundary surface area in the country is the sum of the surface areas in the country of each \n\nof the transboundary basins and aquifers (expressed in km2). Transboundary areas for different types of \n\nsystems (e.g. river basin and aquifer) or multiple aquifers may overlap. The area of transboundary \n\naquifers, even if located within a transboundary river basin, should be added to be able to track progress \n\nof cooperation on transboundary aquifers.  \n\n\fLast updated: 18 November 2016 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe calculations can most easily be carried with Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Once generated, \n\nwith appropriate tools for spatial analysis, the shapes of the surface catchments and the aquifers can be \n\nused to report both disaggregated (for the surface water basin or aquifer) and aggregated (agreement \n\nexists on either one). \n\nStep 3 Review existing arrangements for transboundary cooperation in water management and verify \n\nwhich transboundary waters are covered by a cooperation arrangement \n\nSome operational arrangements for integrated management of transboundary waters in place cover both \n\nsurface waters and groundwaters. In such cases, it should be clear that the geographical extent of both is \n\nused to calculate the indicator value. \n\nIn other cases, the area of application may be limited to a border section of the watercourse and in such \n\ncases only the corresponding area should be considered as potentially having an operational \n\narrangement for calculating the indicator value.  \n\nAt the end of this step, it should be known which transboundary basins are covered by cooperation \n\narrangements (and their respective areas).  \n\nStep 4 Check which of the existing arrangements for transboundary cooperation in water management \n\nare operational \n\nThe following check-list allows determining whether the cooperation arrangement on a particular basin \n\nor in relation to a particular co-riparian country is operational: \n\n- existence of a joint body, joint mechanism or commission for transboundary cooperation  \n\n- regularity of formal communication in form of meetings  \n\n- existence of joint or coordinated water management plan(s), or of joint objectives  \n\n- regular exchange of information and data  \n\nIf any of the conditions is not met, the cooperation arrangement cannot be considered operational. This \n\ninformation is currently available in countries and can also be withdrawn from global, regional or basin \n\nreporting systems. \n\nStep 5  \n\nCalculate the indicator value, that is, the area share by adding up the surface area in the country of those \n\ntransboundary surface water basins or aquifers that are covered by an operational cooperation \n\narrangement and dividing it by the total summed up area in the country of all transboundary basins \n\n(including aquifers), multiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage share.\" \n\nDisaggregation: \n\nData would be most reliably collected at the national level. Basin level data can also be disaggregated to \n\ncountry level (for national reporting) and aggregated to regional and global level. \n\n\fLast updated: 18 November 2016 \n\n \n\n \n\nvalue.  \n\nlevel.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTreatment of missing values: \n\n•  At country level \n\nIn the case of spatial data: For the basin delineations, Digital Elevation Model information can be \n\nused to delineate surface water basin boundaries. For aquifers, geological maps can provide a basis \n\nfor approximating aquifer extent. In the case of groundwater, uncertainty about transboundary \n\nnature remains unless investigations of hydraulic properties have been made. In the absence of \n\nadministrative records, gaps about the cooperation arrangements are difficult to fill. \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\nThe indicator is not appropriate for countries without a terrestrial border, so notably island states \n\nwill not be reporting a value on this indicator. \n\nInternational databases and inventories (as described in section 6) are available for reference in the \n\nabsence of information reported by countries. Missing surface water basin extent can be extracted \n\nfrom Digital Elevation Models available globally.

It means that \n\nthe total transboundary basin area need to be reported at national level, in addition to the indicator \n\nThe information collected with the reporting under the Water Convention can support disaggregation at \n\nbasin level and distinguishing aquifers and river basins, and support aggregation at the global or regional \n\nBaseline assessment from global database can be performed at any desired geographical scale: sub-\n\nnational, national, regional, basin scale, global, etc. \n\nSources of discrepancies: \n\nAs the computation of the indicator is based on the spatial information (“transboundary basin area”) and \n\noperationality of arrangements as the two basic components, differences can arise in difference of the \n\ncomputation of each of these components individually. \n\nRegarding both components, the Member States have the most up-to-date information, which can be \n\nsupplemented by the data from various international projects and inventories, which contribute also to \n\nestablishing a baseline globally. \n\n\fLast updated: 18 November 2016 \n\nThe difference on the value of transboundary basin area can arise from a different delineation of the \n\ntransboundary water bodies, especially aquifers, or even the consideration of their transboundary nature \n\nas their identification and delineation can be based on different hydrogeological studies and can be \n\nupdated, which is not necessarily reflected in international database. \n\nThe difference in the consideration of the operationality of the arrangements may arise from not \n\nidentifying the same arrangements or considering differently the four criteria that serve as the basis for \n\nthe operationality classification:  \n\n- existence of a joint body, joint mechanism or commission for transboundary cooperation  \n\n- regularity of formal communication in form of meetings  \n\n- existence of joint or coordinated water management plan(s), or of joint objectives  \n\n- regular exchange of information and data  \n\nA different interpretation in the object of application (only surface water or both surface water and \n\ngroundwater) may constitute another reason. \n\nCollection of country input through validation mechanisms, notably the reporting under the Water \n\nConvention is expected to improve the consistency and accuracy of the information across the countries \n\nas the monitoring progresses.\" \n\n \nData Sources \n\nDescription: \n\nAt the country level, ministries and agencies responsible for surface water and groundwater resources \n\n(depends on the country but commonly ministry of the environment, water, natural resources, energy or \n\nagriculture; institutes of water resources, hydrology or geology, or geological surveys) typically have the \n\nspatial information about the location and extent of the surface water basin boundaries and aquifer \n\ndelineations (as Geographical Information Systems shapefiles). Information on existing arrangement and \n\ntheir operationality is also commonly available from the same institutions. \n\nRegular reporting contributing to the information collection \n\nReporting under the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and \n\nInternational Lakes (Water Convention) will also gather the information needed for the calculation of the \n\nindicator, especially on the cooperation arrangements, transboundary waters covered by them as well as \n\noperationality.

It is derived by adding up the surface area in a country of those \n\ntransboundary surface water catchments and transboundary aquifers (i.e. ‘transboundary’ basins) that \n\nare covered by an operational arrangement and dividing the obtained area by the aggregate total area in \n\na country of all transboundary basins (both catchments and aquifers). The result is multiplied by 100 to \n\nobtain it expressed as percentage share. \n\nRationale: \n\nMost of the world’s water resources are shared: 592 transboundary aquifers have been identified and \n\ntransboundary lake and river basins cover nearly one half of the Earth’s land surface and account for an \n\nestimated 60% of global freshwater. Approximately 40% of the world’s population lives in river and lake \n\nbasins shared by two or more countries and over 90% lives in countries that share basins. Development \n\nof water resources has impacts across transboundary basins, potentially on co-riparian countries, and use \n\nof surface water or groundwater may affect the other resource, these usually being interlinked. Intensive \n\nwater use, flow regulation or pollution risks going as far as compromising co-riparian countries’ \n\ndevelopment aspirations and therefore transboundary cooperation is required. However, cooperation is \n\nin most cases not advanced.  \n\nSpecific agreements or other arrangements concluded between co-riparian countries are a key \n\nprecondition to ensure long-term, sustainable cooperation. International customary water law (as \n\nreflected in the Convention on the Law of the Non-navigational Uses of International Watercourses (New \n\nYork, 1997), the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International \n\nLakes (Helsinki, 1992), and the draft Articles on The Law of Transboundary Aquifers (2008; UN General \n\nAssembly resolutions 63/124, 66/104, and 68/118)), as well as existing experience and good practices, all \n\npoint to minimum requirements for operational cooperation. These minimum requirements are captured \n\nby the four criteria for operationality. \n\n\fLast updated: 18 November 2016 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThis is the basis for the explicit call for transboundary water cooperation in the wording of target 6.5 and \n\nthe importance of monitoring this indicator to complement indicator 6.5.1 which measures the \n\nadvancement of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM). \n\nProgress by a particular country towards the cooperation aspect of target 6.5, reflected by the value of \n\nindicator 6.5.2, can be achieved either by establishing new operational cooperation arrangements with \n\nco-riparian countries, or making existing arrangements operational by developing and regularizing \n\nactivities, or expanding the coverage of cooperation arrangements with the ultimate objective to cover \n\nall surface waters and groundwaters. \n\nConcepts: \n\n\"The proposed monitoring has as basis the spatial coverage of transboundary basins shared by each \n\ncountry, and focuses on monitoring whether these are covered by cooperation arrangements that are \n\noperational. The criteria needing to be met for the cooperation on a specific basin being considered \n\n“operational” seeks to capture whether the arrangement(s) indeed provide an adequate basis for \n\ncooperation in water management.  \n\nTransboundary basins are basins of transboundary waters, that is, of any surface waters (notably rivers, \n\nlakes) or groundwaters which mark, cross or are located on boundaries between by two or more states. \n\nFor the purpose of the calculation of this indicator, for surface waters, the basin is the extent of the \n\ncatchment area; for groundwater, the area considered is the extent of the aquifer.  \n\nArrangement for water cooperation: a bilateral or multilateral treaty, convention, agreement or other \n\nformal arrangement, such as memorandum of understanding) between riparian countries that provides a \n\nframework for cooperation on transboundary water management. Agreements or other kind of formal \n\narrangements may be interstate, intergovernmental, interministerial, interagency or between regional \n\nauthorities.  \n\nOperational: For an agreement or other kind of formal arrangement (e.g. a memorandum of \n\nunderstanding) for cooperation between the riparian countries to be considered operational, all the \n\nfollowing criteria needs to be fulfilled:  \n\n- There is a joint body, joint mechanism or commission (e.g. a river basin organization) for transboundary \n\ncooperation  \n\n- There are regular formal communications between riparian countries in form of meetings  \n\n- There is a joint or coordinated water management plan(s), or joint objectives have been set \n\n- There is a regular exchange of data and information. \n\nComments and limitations: \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLast updated: 18 November 2016 \n\nThe spatial information on transboundary surface water basins’ boundaries and the extents of the \n\ncatchment areas are commonly available and essentially static; consequently, once determined, no \n\nupdating need is expected. \n\nThe information on the areal extent of transboundary aquifers may evolve over time as such information \n\nis generally more coarse but likely to improve because of the evolving knowledge on aquifers. Technical \n\nstudies and exchange of information will improve the delineation and might also lead to the identification \n\nof additional transboundary aquifers. \n\nIn situations where more than two riparian countries share a basin, but only some of them have \n\noperational cooperation arrangements, the indicator value may mask the gap that a riparian country \n\ndoes not have cooperation arrangements with both its upstream and downstream neighbours. Such \n\ncomplementary information can be obtained by aggregating data at the level of the basins but not from \n\nthe reporting at the national level.  \n\nThe legal basis for cooperation develops slowly: conclusion of new agreements on transboundary waters \n\nis commonly a long process that takes many years.  \n\nThe operationality of cooperation is more dynamic as it evolves with the expansion of cooperation. The \n\noperationality can be expected to evolve over shorter time frames, and in a year or two, progress could \n\npotentially be observed. \n\n \nMethodology \n\nComputation Method: \n\nStep 1 Identify the transboundary surface waters and aquifers \n\nWhile the identification of transboundary surface water is straightforward, the identification of \n\ntransboundary aquifers requires investigations. \n\nIf there are no transboundary surface waters or groundwaters, reporting is not applicable. \n\nStep 2 Calculate the surface area of each transboundary basin and the total sum \n\nCommonly at least the basins of the rivers and lakes have been delineated through topographic maps and \n\nthe basin area is known or easily measurable.  \n\nThe total transboundary surface area in the country is the sum of the surface areas in the country of each \n\nof the transboundary basins and aquifers (expressed in km2). Transboundary areas for different types of \n\nsystems (e.g. river basin and aquifer) or multiple aquifers may overlap. The area of transboundary \n\naquifers, even if located within a transboundary river basin, should be added to be able to track progress \n\nof cooperation on transboundary aquifers.  \n\n\fLast updated: 18 November 2016 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe calculations can most easily be carried with Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Once generated, \n\nwith appropriate tools for spatial analysis, the shapes of the surface catchments and the aquifers can be \n\nused to report both disaggregated (for the surface water basin or aquifer) and aggregated (agreement \n\nexists on either one). \n\nStep 3 Review existing arrangements for transboundary cooperation in water management and verify \n\nwhich transboundary waters are covered by a cooperation arrangement \n\nSome operational arrangements for integrated management of transboundary waters in place cover both \n\nsurface waters and groundwaters. In such cases, it should be clear that the geographical extent of both is \n\nused to calculate the indicator value. \n\nIn other cases, the area of application may be limited to a border section of the watercourse and in such \n\ncases only the corresponding area should be considered as potentially having an operational \n\narrangement for calculating the indicator value.  \n\nAt the end of this step, it should be known which transboundary basins are covered by cooperation \n\narrangements (and their respective areas).  \n\nStep 4 Check which of the existing arrangements for transboundary cooperation in water management \n\nare operational \n\nThe following check-list allows determining whether the cooperation arrangement on a particular basin \n\nor in relation to a particular co-riparian country is operational: \n\n- existence of a joint body, joint mechanism or commission for transboundary cooperation  \n\n- regularity of formal communication in form of meetings  \n\n- existence of joint or coordinated water management plan(s), or of joint objectives  \n\n- regular exchange of information and data  \n\nIf any of the conditions is not met, the cooperation arrangement cannot be considered operational. This \n\ninformation is currently available in countries and can also be withdrawn from global, regional or basin \n\nreporting systems. \n\nStep 5  \n\nCalculate the indicator value, that is, the area share by adding up the surface area in the country of those \n\ntransboundary surface water basins or aquifers that are covered by an operational cooperation \n\narrangement and dividing it by the total summed up area in the country of all transboundary basins \n\n(including aquifers), multiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage share.\" \n\nDisaggregation: \n\nData would be most reliably collected at the national level. Basin level data can also be disaggregated to \n\ncountry level (for national reporting) and aggregated to regional and global level. \n\n\fLast updated: 18 November 2016 \n\n \n\n \n\nvalue.  \n\nlevel.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTreatment of missing values: \n\n•  At country level \n\nIn the case of spatial data: For the basin delineations, Digital Elevation Model information can be \n\nused to delineate surface water basin boundaries. For aquifers, geological maps can provide a basis \n\nfor approximating aquifer extent. In the case of groundwater, uncertainty about transboundary \n\nnature remains unless investigations of hydraulic properties have been made. In the absence of \n\nadministrative records, gaps about the cooperation arrangements are difficult to fill. \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\nThe indicator is not appropriate for countries without a terrestrial border, so notably island states \n\nwill not be reporting a value on this indicator. \n\nInternational databases and inventories (as described in section 6) are available for reference in the \n\nabsence of information reported by countries. Missing surface water basin extent can be extracted \n\nfrom Digital Elevation Models available globally. Global geological maps and maps of \n\nhydrogeology/groundwater potential also exist which could be used to approximate aquifer extent \n\nConcerning agreements, consistency of information reported by co-riparian countries can be used \n\nto fill gaps in information about agreements and their operationality. \n\n(surface area). \n\nRegional aggregates: \n\nRegional and global estimates will be obtained by summing up the total transboundary basin areas with \n\narrangement and dividing the result by the total transboundary basin area of the countries. It means that \n\nthe total transboundary basin area need to be reported at national level, in addition to the indicator \n\nThe information collected with the reporting under the Water Convention can support disaggregation at \n\nbasin level and distinguishing aquifers and river basins, and support aggregation at the global or regional \n\nBaseline assessment from global database can be performed at any desired geographical scale: sub-\n\nnational, national, regional, basin scale, global, etc. \n\nSources of discrepancies: \n\nAs the computation of the indicator is based on the spatial information (“transboundary basin area”) and \n\noperationality of arrangements as the two basic components, differences can arise in difference of the \n\ncomputation of each of these components individually. \n\nRegarding both components, the Member States have the most up-to-date information, which can be \n\nsupplemented by the data from various international projects and inventories, which contribute also to \n\nestablishing a baseline globally. \n\n\fLast updated: 18 November 2016 \n\nThe difference on the value of transboundary basin area can arise from a different delineation of the \n\ntransboundary water bodies, especially aquifers, or even the consideration of their transboundary nature \n\nas their identification and delineation can be based on different hydrogeological studies and can be \n\nupdated, which is not necessarily reflected in international database. \n\nThe difference in the consideration of the operationality of the arrangements may arise from not \n\nidentifying the same arrangements or considering differently the four criteria that serve as the basis for \n\nthe operationality classification:  \n\n- existence of a joint body, joint mechanism or commission for transboundary cooperation  \n\n- regularity of formal communication in form of meetings  \n\n- existence of joint or coordinated water management plan(s), or of joint objectives  \n\n- regular exchange of information and data  \n\nA different interpretation in the object of application (only surface water or both surface water and \n\ngroundwater) may constitute another reason. \n\nCollection of country input through validation mechanisms, notably the reporting under the Water \n\nConvention is expected to improve the consistency and accuracy of the information across the countries \n\nas the monitoring progresses.\" \n\n \nData Sources \n\nDescription: \n\nAt the country level, ministries and agencies responsible for surface water and groundwater resources \n\n(depends on the country but commonly ministry of the environment, water, natural resources, energy or \n\nagriculture; institutes of water resources, hydrology or geology, or geological surveys) typically have the \n\nspatial information about the location and extent of the surface water basin boundaries and aquifer \n\ndelineations (as Geographical Information Systems shapefiles). Information on existing arrangement and \n\ntheir operationality is also commonly available from the same institutions. \n\nRegular reporting contributing to the information collection \n\nReporting under the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and \n\nInternational Lakes (Water Convention) will also gather the information needed for the calculation of the \n\nindicator, especially on the cooperation arrangements, transboundary waters covered by them as well as \n\noperationality.

It is derived by adding up the surface area in a country of those \n\ntransboundary surface water catchments and transboundary aquifers (i.e. ‘transboundary’ basins) that \n\nare covered by an operational arrangement and dividing the obtained area by the aggregate total area in \n\na country of all transboundary basins (both catchments and aquifers). The result is multiplied by 100 to \n\nobtain it expressed as percentage share. \n\nRationale: \n\nMost of the world’s water resources are shared: 592 transboundary aquifers have been identified and \n\ntransboundary lake and river basins cover nearly one half of the Earth’s land surface and account for an \n\nestimated 60% of global freshwater. Approximately 40% of the world’s population lives in river and lake \n\nbasins shared by two or more countries and over 90% lives in countries that share basins. Development \n\nof water resources has impacts across transboundary basins, potentially on co-riparian countries, and use \n\nof surface water or groundwater may affect the other resource, these usually being interlinked. Intensive \n\nwater use, flow regulation or pollution risks going as far as compromising co-riparian countries’ \n\ndevelopment aspirations and therefore transboundary cooperation is required. However, cooperation is \n\nin most cases not advanced.  \n\nSpecific agreements or other arrangements concluded between co-riparian countries are a key \n\nprecondition to ensure long-term, sustainable cooperation. International customary water law (as \n\nreflected in the Convention on the Law of the Non-navigational Uses of International Watercourses (New \n\nYork, 1997), the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International \n\nLakes (Helsinki, 1992), and the draft Articles on The Law of Transboundary Aquifers (2008; UN General \n\nAssembly resolutions 63/124, 66/104, and 68/118)), as well as existing experience and good practices, all \n\npoint to minimum requirements for operational cooperation. These minimum requirements are captured \n\nby the four criteria for operationality. \n\n\fLast updated: 18 November 2016 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThis is the basis for the explicit call for transboundary water cooperation in the wording of target 6.5 and \n\nthe importance of monitoring this indicator to complement indicator 6.5.1 which measures the \n\nadvancement of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM). \n\nProgress by a particular country towards the cooperation aspect of target 6.5, reflected by the value of \n\nindicator 6.5.2, can be achieved either by establishing new operational cooperation arrangements with \n\nco-riparian countries, or making existing arrangements operational by developing and regularizing \n\nactivities, or expanding the coverage of cooperation arrangements with the ultimate objective to cover \n\nall surface waters and groundwaters. \n\nConcepts: \n\n\"The proposed monitoring has as basis the spatial coverage of transboundary basins shared by each \n\ncountry, and focuses on monitoring whether these are covered by cooperation arrangements that are \n\noperational. The criteria needing to be met for the cooperation on a specific basin being considered \n\n“operational” seeks to capture whether the arrangement(s) indeed provide an adequate basis for \n\ncooperation in water management.  \n\nTransboundary basins are basins of transboundary waters, that is, of any surface waters (notably rivers, \n\nlakes) or groundwaters which mark, cross or are located on boundaries between by two or more states. \n\nFor the purpose of the calculation of this indicator, for surface waters, the basin is the extent of the \n\ncatchment area; for groundwater, the area considered is the extent of the aquifer.  \n\nArrangement for water cooperation: a bilateral or multilateral treaty, convention, agreement or other \n\nformal arrangement, such as memorandum of understanding) between riparian countries that provides a \n\nframework for cooperation on transboundary water management. Agreements or other kind of formal \n\narrangements may be interstate, intergovernmental, interministerial, interagency or between regional \n\nauthorities.  \n\nOperational: For an agreement or other kind of formal arrangement (e.g. a memorandum of \n\nunderstanding) for cooperation between the riparian countries to be considered operational, all the \n\nfollowing criteria needs to be fulfilled:  \n\n- There is a joint body, joint mechanism or commission (e.g. a river basin organization) for transboundary \n\ncooperation  \n\n- There are regular formal communications between riparian countries in form of meetings  \n\n- There is a joint or coordinated water management plan(s), or joint objectives have been set \n\n- There is a regular exchange of data and information. \n\nComments and limitations: \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLast updated: 18 November 2016 \n\nThe spatial information on transboundary surface water basins’ boundaries and the extents of the \n\ncatchment areas are commonly available and essentially static; consequently, once determined, no \n\nupdating need is expected. \n\nThe information on the areal extent of transboundary aquifers may evolve over time as such information \n\nis generally more coarse but likely to improve because of the evolving knowledge on aquifers. Technical \n\nstudies and exchange of information will improve the delineation and might also lead to the identification \n\nof additional transboundary aquifers. \n\nIn situations where more than two riparian countries share a basin, but only some of them have \n\noperational cooperation arrangements, the indicator value may mask the gap that a riparian country \n\ndoes not have cooperation arrangements with both its upstream and downstream neighbours. Such \n\ncomplementary information can be obtained by aggregating data at the level of the basins but not from \n\nthe reporting at the national level.  \n\nThe legal basis for cooperation develops slowly: conclusion of new agreements on transboundary waters \n\nis commonly a long process that takes many years.  \n\nThe operationality of cooperation is more dynamic as it evolves with the expansion of cooperation. The \n\noperationality can be expected to evolve over shorter time frames, and in a year or two, progress could \n\npotentially be observed. \n\n \nMethodology \n\nComputation Method: \n\nStep 1 Identify the transboundary surface waters and aquifers \n\nWhile the identification of transboundary surface water is straightforward, the identification of \n\ntransboundary aquifers requires investigations. \n\nIf there are no transboundary surface waters or groundwaters, reporting is not applicable. \n\nStep 2 Calculate the surface area of each transboundary basin and the total sum \n\nCommonly at least the basins of the rivers and lakes have been delineated through topographic maps and \n\nthe basin area is known or easily measurable.  \n\nThe total transboundary surface area in the country is the sum of the surface areas in the country of each \n\nof the transboundary basins and aquifers (expressed in km2). Transboundary areas for different types of \n\nsystems (e.g. river basin and aquifer) or multiple aquifers may overlap. The area of transboundary \n\naquifers, even if located within a transboundary river basin, should be added to be able to track progress \n\nof cooperation on transboundary aquifers.  \n\n\fLast updated: 18 November 2016 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe calculations can most easily be carried with Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Once generated, \n\nwith appropriate tools for spatial analysis, the shapes of the surface catchments and the aquifers can be \n\nused to report both disaggregated (for the surface water basin or aquifer) and aggregated (agreement \n\nexists on either one). \n\nStep 3 Review existing arrangements for transboundary cooperation in water management and verify \n\nwhich transboundary waters are covered by a cooperation arrangement \n\nSome operational arrangements for integrated management of transboundary waters in place cover both \n\nsurface waters and groundwaters. In such cases, it should be clear that the geographical extent of both is \n\nused to calculate the indicator value. \n\nIn other cases, the area of application may be limited to a border section of the watercourse and in such \n\ncases only the corresponding area should be considered as potentially having an operational \n\narrangement for calculating the indicator value.  \n\nAt the end of this step, it should be known which transboundary basins are covered by cooperation \n\narrangements (and their respective areas).  \n\nStep 4 Check which of the existing arrangements for transboundary cooperation in water management \n\nare operational \n\nThe following check-list allows determining whether the cooperation arrangement on a particular basin \n\nor in relation to a particular co-riparian country is operational: \n\n- existence of a joint body, joint mechanism or commission for transboundary cooperation  \n\n- regularity of formal communication in form of meetings  \n\n- existence of joint or coordinated water management plan(s), or of joint objectives  \n\n- regular exchange of information and data  \n\nIf any of the conditions is not met, the cooperation arrangement cannot be considered operational. This \n\ninformation is currently available in countries and can also be withdrawn from global, regional or basin \n\nreporting systems. \n\nStep 5  \n\nCalculate the indicator value, that is, the area share by adding up the surface area in the country of those \n\ntransboundary surface water basins or aquifers that are covered by an operational cooperation \n\narrangement and dividing it by the total summed up area in the country of all transboundary basins \n\n(including aquifers), multiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage share.\" \n\nDisaggregation: \n\nData would be most reliably collected at the national level. Basin level data can also be disaggregated to \n\ncountry level (for national reporting) and aggregated to regional and global level. \n\n\fLast updated: 18 November 2016 \n\n \n\n \n\nvalue.  \n\nlevel.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTreatment of missing values: \n\n•  At country level \n\nIn the case of spatial data: For the basin delineations, Digital Elevation Model information can be \n\nused to delineate surface water basin boundaries. For aquifers, geological maps can provide a basis \n\nfor approximating aquifer extent. In the case of groundwater, uncertainty about transboundary \n\nnature remains unless investigations of hydraulic properties have been made. In the absence of \n\nadministrative records, gaps about the cooperation arrangements are difficult to fill. \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\nThe indicator is not appropriate for countries without a terrestrial border, so notably island states \n\nwill not be reporting a value on this indicator. \n\nInternational databases and inventories (as described in section 6) are available for reference in the \n\nabsence of information reported by countries. Missing surface water basin extent can be extracted \n\nfrom Digital Elevation Models available globally. Global geological maps and maps of \n\nhydrogeology/groundwater potential also exist which could be used to approximate aquifer extent \n\nConcerning agreements, consistency of information reported by co-riparian countries can be used \n\nto fill gaps in information about agreements and their operationality. \n\n(surface area). \n\nRegional aggregates: \n\nRegional and global estimates will be obtained by summing up the total transboundary basin areas with \n\narrangement and dividing the result by the total transboundary basin area of the countries. It means that \n\nthe total transboundary basin area need to be reported at national level, in addition to the indicator \n\nThe information collected with the reporting under the Water Convention can support disaggregation at \n\nbasin level and distinguishing aquifers and river basins, and support aggregation at the global or regional \n\nBaseline assessment from global database can be performed at any desired geographical scale: sub-\n\nnational, national, regional, basin scale, global, etc. \n\nSources of discrepancies: \n\nAs the computation of the indicator is based on the spatial information (“transboundary basin area”) and \n\noperationality of arrangements as the two basic components, differences can arise in difference of the \n\ncomputation of each of these components individually. \n\nRegarding both components, the Member States have the most up-to-date information, which can be \n\nsupplemented by the data from various international projects and inventories, which contribute also to \n\nestablishing a baseline globally. \n\n\fLast updated: 18 November 2016 \n\nThe difference on the value of transboundary basin area can arise from a different delineation of the \n\ntransboundary water bodies, especially aquifers, or even the consideration of their transboundary nature \n\nas their identification and delineation can be based on different hydrogeological studies and can be \n\nupdated, which is not necessarily reflected in international database. \n\nThe difference in the consideration of the operationality of the arrangements may arise from not \n\nidentifying the same arrangements or considering differently the four criteria that serve as the basis for \n\nthe operationality classification:  \n\n- existence of a joint body, joint mechanism or commission for transboundary cooperation  \n\n- regularity of formal communication in form of meetings  \n\n- existence of joint or coordinated water management plan(s), or of joint objectives  \n\n- regular exchange of information and data  \n\nA different interpretation in the object of application (only surface water or both surface water and \n\ngroundwater) may constitute another reason. \n\nCollection of country input through validation mechanisms, notably the reporting under the Water \n\nConvention is expected to improve the consistency and accuracy of the information across the countries \n\nas the monitoring progresses.\" \n\n \nData Sources \n\nDescription: \n\nAt the country level, ministries and agencies responsible for surface water and groundwater resources \n\n(depends on the country but commonly ministry of the environment, water, natural resources, energy or \n\nagriculture; institutes of water resources, hydrology or geology, or geological surveys) typically have the \n\nspatial information about the location and extent of the surface water basin boundaries and aquifer \n\ndelineations (as Geographical Information Systems shapefiles). Information on existing arrangement and \n\ntheir operationality is also commonly available from the same institutions. \n\nRegular reporting contributing to the information collection \n\nReporting under the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and \n\nInternational Lakes (Water Convention) will also gather the information needed for the calculation of the \n\nindicator, especially on the cooperation arrangements, transboundary waters covered by them as well as \n\noperationality.

Some countries already report to regional organizations (e.g. the European Union or \n\nthe Southern African Development Community) on the advancement of transboundary water \n\ncooperation, and similar arrangements could be strengthened and facilitated. \n\n \nReferences \n\nURL: \n\nReferences: \n\nhttp://www.unesco.org/new/en/ihp; http://www.unece.org/env/water/ \n\nThe methodology is established and is based on the main principles of customary international water law, \n\nalso contained in the two UN conventions - Convention on the Law of the Non-navigational Uses of \n\nInternational Watercourses (New York, 1997) and the Convention on the Protection and Use of \n\nTransboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Helsinki, 1992) – as well as the draft Articles on \n\nThe Law of Transboundary Aquifers (2008; UN General Assembly resolutions 63/124 and 66/104). \n\nConvention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes: a \n\nglobalizing framework  \n\nhttp://www.unece.org/env/water.html  \n\nReporting under the Water Convention  \n\nhttp://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/documents/2015/WAT/11Nov_1719_MOP7_Budapest/ECE_\n\nMP.WAT_2015_7_reporting_decision_ENG.pdf \n\nGEMI – Integrated Monitoring of Water and Sanitation-related SDG Targets.
