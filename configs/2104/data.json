This, in turn, is premised on aspects of the right to be presumed innocent until \nproven guilty. From a development perspective, extensive use of pre-sentence detention when not \nnecessary for reasons such as the prevention of absconding, the protection of victims or witnesses, or the \nprevention of the commission of further offences, can divert criminal justice system resources, and exert \nfinancial and unemployment burdens on the accused and his or her family. Measuring the relative extent \nto which pre-sentence detention is used can provide the evidence to assist countries in lowering such \nburdens and ensuring its proportionate use. \n \nConcepts: \n \n‘Sentenced’ refers to persons subject to criminal proceedings who have received a decision from a \ncompetent authority regarding their conviction or acquittal. For the purposes of the indicator, persons \nwho have received a ‘non-final’ decision (such as where a conviction is subject to appeal) are considered \nto be ‘sentenced’. \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nThe target relates to the multidimensional concepts of rule of law and access to justice and at least two \nindicators are required to cover the main elements of access to justice and efficiency of the justice \nsystem. The proposed indicator 16.3.2 covers the efficiency of the justice system. \n \n\n\f \n\nMethodology \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\n \nComputation Method: \n \nThe total number of unsentenced persons held in detention divided by the total number of persons held \nin detention, on a specified date. \n \nDisaggregation: \n \nRecommended disaggregation for this indicator are: \n- age and sex \n- length of pre-trial (unsentenced) detention \n \nTreatment of missing values: \n \n\n•  At country level \n\n \nIf all values for a given period and country are missing, then the missing values are left blank. If only \ncertain years in the period are missing, then missing values for that year are left blank and are not \ntaken into account when computing the three year average for that country. \n \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\n \nMissing values are left blank and are not taken into account when computing regional averages. \n \n\nRegional aggregates: \n \nWeighted averages are the preferred method for calculating regional and global average rates. For this \npurpose, regional averages of the proportion of unsentenced detainees are obtained by adding up the \nnumber of unsentenced persons held in the region and dividing the total by the sum of the total number \nof persons held in detention in the region. Similarly, global averages of the proportion of unsentenced \ndetainees are obtained by adding up the number of unsentenced persons held globally and dividing the \ntotal by the sum of the total number of persons held in detention globally. \n \nSources of discrepancies: \n \nUNODC only compiles data from national sources, therefore no differences among the values should \nexist. \n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \n \nUNODC collects data on prisons through its annual data collection (UN-CTS). The data collection through \nthe UN-CTS is facilitated by a network of over 130 national Focal Points appointed by responsible \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\nauthorities. Data on unsentenced and total detainees from the UN-CTS are available for 114 countries. \nThe country coverage can improve if other sources (research institutions and NGOs) are included (data \nfor additional 60 countries are available, bringing the total for the period 2012-2014 to 174 countries). \nData for two points in time (2003-2005 and 2012-2014 three year averages) are available for 144 \ncountries. \n \nCollection process: \n \nThere is a consolidated system of annual data collection on crime and criminal justice (UN- Crime Trends \nSurvey, UN-CTS) which represents the basis of data on unsentenced detainees. The UN-CTS data \ncollection is largely based on the network of national Focal Points, which are institutions/officials \nappointed by countries and having the technical capacity and role to produce data on crime and criminal \njustice (around 130 appointed Focal Points as of 2016). In addition, these data are supplemented for \ncountries with missing values with official data collected by the Institute for Criminal Policy Research \n(World Prison Brief), which collects data directly from national prison administrations or from the \nwebsites of Ministries of Justice or other official agencies. For future SDG reporting data will be sent to \ncountries for consultation prior to publication. \n \nData Availability \n\n \nDescription: \n \nThe target relates to the multidimensional concepts of rule of law and access to justice and at least two \nindicators are required to cover the main elements of access to justice and efficiency of the justice \nsystem.
