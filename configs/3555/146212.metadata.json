    "additionalInfo": "The IUCN Red List has assessed only a small share of the total known species in the world. This means the number of species threatened with extinction is likely to be a significant underestimate of the total number of species at risk.\n\nThis is particularly true for understudied groups such as insects, plants and fungi.\n\nThe share of known species threatened with extinction is only available for a few taxonomic groups where more than 80% of species have been assessed.\n\n'Threatened' species are those that are categorized as 'Critically endangered', 'Endangered' or 'Vulnerable' on the IUCN Red List.\n\nThis dataset should be next updated by the source in December 2022. We will update it on Our World in Data soon after the new version is published. At the link above you can directly access the source page and see the latest available data.\n\nThe 'mushrooms' taxonomic group includes brackets, rusts, smuts and, jelly fungi."
