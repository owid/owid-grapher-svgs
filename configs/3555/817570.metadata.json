This means the number of species threatened with extinction is likely to be a significant underestimate of the total number of species at risk.\n\nThis is particularly true for understudied groups such as insects, plants and fungi.\n\nThe share of known species threatened with extinction is only available for a few taxonomic groups where more than 80% of species have been assessed.\n\n'Threatened' species are those that are categorized as 'Critically endangered', 'Endangered' or 'Vulnerable' on the IUCN Red List.",
