A country is more vulnerable to pollinator decline if a lot of its crop output is pollinator-dependent crops and it has low levels of crop diversity. This makes its food system dependent on the growth of only a few crops.","createdAt":"2021-06-24T19:18:29.000Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-24T19:22:28.000Z","code":null,"coverage":"","timespan":"","datasetId":5334,"sourceId":18054,"shortUnit":null,"display":{"name":"Change in dependency vulnerability to pollinators","includeInTable":true},"columnOrder":0,"originalMetadata":null,"datasetName":"Pollinator dependency of agriculture (Aizen et al. 2019)","s_id":18054,"s_name":"Aizen et al.

A crop is considered to be pollinator-dependent if animal pollination is required to increase the quantity and/or the quality of fruits or seeds directly consumed by humans.
