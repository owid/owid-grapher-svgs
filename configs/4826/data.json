Note these shares may sum to more than 100% since many species are traded as both pets and for their products."}}},"entityKey":{"84166":{"name":"Mammals","code":null},"84167":{"name":"Birds","code":null},"84168":{"name":"Reptiles","code":null},"84169":{"name":"Amphibians","code":null},"84171":{"name":"Vertebrates","code":null}}}
