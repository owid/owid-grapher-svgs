Unfortunately, for certain regions and years the data survey coverage is too low and the results are suppressed. From 1990 onwards, it is only for South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa (on different years) that regional estimates are sometimes missing.\n\nFor these years we calculate the number of poor in the region as the difference between the estimated total number of poor across the world and the sum of the number of poor across all other regions.\n\nPrior to 1990 estimates for more than one region are missing, precluding this method.",
