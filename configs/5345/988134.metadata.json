    "COVAX is an international initiative led by Gavi, CEPI, and WHO to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, regardless of a country's wealth.",
    "Through the COVAX Facility, self-financing countries pool funds to procure vaccines, while 92 lower-income countries receive free doses supported by donor funding through the Gavi COVAX AMC.",
    "Donations to COVAX help scale up vaccine manufacturing capacity early, preventing significant delays or shortages once vaccines receive approval.",
    "Ensuring widespread vaccine access underpins the 'no one is safe until everyone is safe' principle, aiming to end the pandemic by reducing disparities in vaccination.",
