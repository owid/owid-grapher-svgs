It refers to the efforts by countries to \nimplement the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of \nBenefits Arising from their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity (2010) and the \nInternational Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (2001). \n \nThe Nagoya Protocol covers genetic resources and traditional knowledge associated with genetic \nresources, as well as the benefits arising from their utilization by setting out core obligations for its \ncontracting Parties to take measures in relation to access, benefit-sharing and compliance.  The \nobjectives of the International Treaty are the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources \nfor food and agriculture and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of their use, in \nharmony with the Convention on Biological Diversity.    \n \nThe Protocol provides greater legal certainty and transparency for both providers and users of genetic \nresources and associated traditional knowledge, and therefore, encourages the advancement of research \non genetic resources which could lead to new discoveries for the benefit of all.  \nThe Nagoya Protocol also creates incentives to conserve and sustainably use genetic resources, and \nthereby enhances the contribution of biodiversity to development and human well-being. In addition, \nParties to the Protocol are to encourage users and providers to direct benefits arising from the utilization \nof genetic resources towards the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of its \ncomponents. \n \nThe International Treaty has established the Multilateral System of Access and Benefit-sharing, which \nfacilitates exchanges of plant genetic resources for purposes of agricultural research and breeding, by \nproviding a transparent and reliable framework for the exchange of crop genetic resources. The \nMultilateral System is instrumental to achieving the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic \nresources as well as the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their use.   \n \nRationale and interpretation \nThe Nagoya Protocol, to be operational, requires that certain enabling conditions are met at the national \nlevel for its effective implementation.  In particular, countries will need, depending on their specific \n\n\fLast updated: 31 May 2018 \n\ncircumstances, to revise legislative, administrative or policy measures already in place or develop new \nmeasures in order to meet the obligations set out under the Protocol.   \n \nIn particular, the Nagoya Protocol provides that Parties are to take legislative, administrative or policy \nmeasures, as appropriate, to ensure the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the \nutilization of genetic resources, including for genetic resources that are held by indigenous communities, \nand benefits arising from the utilization of traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources.  \nThe ABS Clearing-House is a platform for exchanging information on access and benefit-sharing \nestablished by Article 14 of the Protocol, The ABS Clearing-House is a key tool for facilitating the \nimplementation of the Nagoya Protocol, by enhancing legal certainty and transparency on procedures for \naccess, and for monitoring the utilization of genetic resources along the value chain. The Protocol \nrequires Parties to make information on legislative, administrative and policy measures available to the \nABS Clearing-House. Non-Parties are also encouraged to make this information available in the same \nmanner. The goal is to allow users of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge to easily \nfind information on the ABS Clearing-House on how to access these resources and knowledge in an \norganized manner, and all in one convenient location. \n \nThe International Treaty stipulates that Contracting Parties ensure the conformity of its laws, regulations \nand procedures with their obligations under the International Treaty (Article 4). Under the Multilateral \nSystem of Access and Benefit-sharing (Articles 10-13), countries grant each other facilitated access to \ntheir plant genetic resources, while users of plant genetic material from the Multilateral System are \nencouraged to share their benefits with the Multilateral System. Such benefits should primarily flow to \nfarmers in developing countries who promote the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic \nresources.  \n \nPursuant to Article 21, the Governing Body adopted the Procedures and operational mechanism to \npromote compliance and address issues of non-compliance.  Under the monitoring and reporting in the \nProcedures, each Contracting Party is requested to submit a report on the measures it has taken to \nimplement its obligations under the International Treaty, including the access and benefit-sharing \nmeasures. Contracting Parties report using an agreed standard format and through the Online Reporting \nSystem on Compliance. Additionally, information on the number of Standard Material Transfer \nAgreements is gathered from the Data Store of the International Treaty through Easy-SMTA. SMTA is a \nmandatory contract that Contracting Parties of the International Treaty have agreed to use whenever \nplant genetic resources falling under the Multilateral System are made available.   \n \nIndicator 15.6.1 directly measures progress made by countries in establishing legislative, administrative \nor policy frameworks on access and benefit-sharing (ABS). By developing their ABS frameworks, countries \nare contributing to the achievement of SDG Target 15.6 and to the conservation and sustainable use of \nbiological and genetic diversity. Progress in this indicator is assessed through measuring the increase in \nthe number of countries that have adopted ABS legislative, administrative and policy measures and that \nhave made available this information in the ABS Clearing-House and through the Online Reporting System \non Compliance of the International Treaty in relation to plant genetic resources for food and agriculture.  \n \nComments and limitations \nThis indicator can be used to measure progress in adopting ABS legislative, administrative and policy \nframeworks over time. \n \n\n\fLast updated: 31 May 2018 \n\nThis indicator does not assess the scope or effectiveness of ABS legislative, administrative and policy \nframeworks.  \n \nThe notion of framework suggests that there is a complete set of rules established on access and benefit-\nsharing. However, it is difficult to have a predefined idea of what constitutes an ABS framework. In the \ncontext of this indicator, the publication by a country of one or more ABS legislative, administrative and \npolicy measure in the ABS Clearing-House would be considered progress by that country on having an \nABS legislative, administrative and policy framework, and through the Online Reporting System on \nCompliance of the International Treaty in relation to plant genetic resources for food and agriculture. \n \nMethodology \n\nComputation Method \nSummation of information made available by each Party to the Convention on Biological Diversity and to \nthe International Treaty related to: \n\n•  ABS legislative, administrative or policy measures made available to the ABS Clearing-House and \n\nto the Online Reporting System on Compliance of the International Treaty in relation to plant \ngenetic resources for food and agriculture (y/n);  \n \n\n• \n\nDisaggregation \nData are provided by countries (or regional integration entities), and can be displayed by country, \nregional group, membership to a specific regional organization, and/or by their status as Parties or non-\nParties to the Protocol and to the International Treaty. \n \nSources of discrepancies \nReliability of the indicator is dependent on countries making information available to the ABS Clearing-\nHouse of the Nagoya Protocol and to the Online Reporting System on Compliance of the International \nTreaty on ABS legislative, administrative or policy measures. \n \nIn addition to the information made available by countries to the ABS Clearing-House, the CBD \nSecretariat collects information from other sources: national biodiversity strategies and actions plans, \nnational reports submitted under the CBD, the interim national reports on the implementation of the \nNagoya Protocol (due in 2017) and official communications to the SCBD (responses to notifications, email \ncommunications, etc.). The information collected from these sources inform the Secretariat’s inputs to \nother processes under the Protocol, in particular the consideration by the Conference of the Parties \nserving as the meeting of the Parties to the Protocol (COP-MOP) of national reports (Article 29) and \nassessment and review (Article 31). The resulting information on the number of countries with ABS \nlegislative, administrative or and policy measures may differ from the number of countries that have \nmade available this information in the ABS Clearing-House.  \n  \nIn addition to the information made available by countries to the Online Reporting System on Compliance \nof the International Treaty, FAO collects information from countries, submitted through their national \nreports, on conservation and use of PGRFA and their efforts in this regard for the preparation of the State \nof the World’s Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture.   \n \nData Sources \n\n\fLast updated: 31 May 2018 \n\nThe Access and Benefit-sharing Clearing-House home page: http://absch.cbd.int \n \nThe Online Reporting System on Compliance of the International Treaty on PGRFA, http://faoitpgrfa.ort-\nproduction.linode.unep-wcmc.org \n \nEasy-SMTA, https://mls.planttreaty.org \n \n\nData Availability \n\nFor 196 Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity. \n \nAvailability of data is dependent on countries making the information on   ABS legislative, administrative \nor and policy measures available to the ABS Clearing- \n \nFor 144 countries that have ratified, accepted, approved or acceded to the International Treaty on Plant \nGenetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (as of 1 February 2018) \nCalendar \n\nData collection \nOngoing. \n \nData release \nFirst data set can be made available by the SCBD in 2016. \nFor the data related to the International Treaty, the updated data was provided as of 1 February 2018.    \n  \nData providers \n\n \nPublishing authorities for the ABS Clearing-House as designated by the CBD national focal points or the ABS \nfocal points.
