        "content": "The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a periodic variation in winds and sea surface temperatures over the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean that affects the climate of regions in the tropics and subtropics. The warming phase of the sea temperature is known as El Niño, and the cooling phase as La Niña. \n\nThe ENSO cycle is defined by changes in atmospheric pressure. El Niño is accompanied by high air surface pressure in the tropical western Pacific, and La Niña with low air surface pressure. The two periods last several months each and tend to occur every few years. The intensity of each cycle can vary.",
