    "additionalInfo": "\nThis dataset comes from the World Mental Health surveys, which conducted national studies in 21 countries, using validated structured interviews to survey members of the general population about symptoms of mental illnesses they had in the past 12 months and their lifetime so far. The source describes the dataset: \"Data came from 24 community epidemiological surveys administered in 21 countries as part of the WMH surveys (Kessler & Ustun, 2004). These included 12 surveys carried out in high-income countries, 6 surveys in upper-middle-income countries and 6 in low or lower-middle income countries (see table 1). The majority of surveys were based on nationally representative household samples. Three were representative of urban areas in their countries (Colombia, Mexico, and Peru). Three were representative of selected regions in their countries (Japan, Nigeria, and Murcia, Spain). Four were representative of selected Metropolitan Areas (Sao Paulo, Brazil; Medellin, Colombia; and Beijing-Shanghai and Shenzhen in the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China (PRC)). Trained lay interviewers conducted face-to-face interviews with respondents, aged 18 years and over. The interviews took place within the households of the respondents. To reduce respondent burden, the interview was divided into two parts. Part I assessed core mental disorders and was administered to all respondents. Part II, which assessed additional disorders and correlates, was administered to all Part I respondents who met lifetime criteria for any disorder plus a probability subsample of other Part I respondents. Part II data, the focus of this report, were weighted by the inverse of their probabilities of selection into Part II and additionally weighted to adjust samples to match population distributions on the cross-classification of key socio-demographic and geographic variables. Further details about WMH sampling and weighting are available elsewhere(Heeringa et al., 2008). Response rates ranged between 45.9% and 97.2% and had a weighted average of 70.1% across all surveys.\"\nData comes from Community surveys of the general population"
