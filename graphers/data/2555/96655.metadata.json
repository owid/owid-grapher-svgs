    "additionalInfo": "The authors modelled the number of excess skin cancer cases they would expect among fair-skinned populations in the United States and Northwest Europe as a result of stratospheric ozone depletion.\n\nThis was modelled for a scenario of no restrictions on ozone-depleting substances, where the authors assumed a 3% annual increase in emissions of chloroflourocarbons (CFCs), halons and methyl chloroforms. \n\nThe Montreal Protocol scenario assumed a decline of five important ozone-depleting substances by 50% by the end of 1999 as agreed in the protocol in 1987.\n\nThe Copenhagen Amendment assumed the production of 21 ozone-depleting substances reduced to zero by the end of 1995."
