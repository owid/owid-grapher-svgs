  "descriptionFromProducer": "Condoms can substantially reduce the risk of sexually transmitting HIV. Consistently and correctly using condoms is therefore important for men who have sex with men because of the high risk of HIV transmission during unprotected anal sex. In addition, men who have anal sex with other men may also have female partners, who could become infected as well. Condom use with the most recent male partner is considered a reliable indicator of longer-term behaviour.\n\nNote: countries with generalized epidemics may also have a concentrated subepidemic among gay men and other men who have sex with men. If so, calculating and reporting on this indicator for this population would be valuable.\n\nMethod of measurement: Behavioural surveillance or other special surveys\n\nIn a behavioural survey of a sample of gay men and other men who have sex with men, respondents are asked about sexual partnerships in the past six months, about anal sex within these partnerships and about condom use when they last had anal sex. Condom use applies whether the respondent is the receptive and insertive partner.\n\nWhenever possible, data for gay men and other men who have sex with men should be collected with civil society organizations that have worked closely with this population in the field.\n\nAccess to gay men and other men who have sex with men and the data collected from them must remain confidential and secure.\n\nMore details: https://indicatorregistry.unaids.org/indicator/men-who-have-sex-men-condom-use",

The data are used to assess progress toward global targets (currently the 95–95–95 targets and post-2025 goals).\n\nThe indicators and questions in this document are designed for use by national AIDS programmes and partners to assess the state of a country's HIV and AIDS response, and to measure progress towards achieving national HIV targets. Countries are encouraged to integrate these indicators and questions into their ongoing monitoring efforts and to report comprehensive national data through the Global AIDS Monitoring (GAM) process. In this way they will contribute to improving understanding of the global response to the HIV epidemic, including progress that has been made towards achieving the commitments and global targets set out in the new United Nations Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS: Ending Inequalities and Getting on Track to End AIDS by 2030, adopted in June 2021, and the linked Sustainable Development Goals.",
