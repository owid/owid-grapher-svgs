The purpose of a clinical trial refers to the main objective or goal of the study, such as testing a new treatment, comparing treatments, or understanding a disease. This includes only [interventional trials](#dod:interventional-trial).\n",
  "descriptionFromProducer": "The main objective of the intervention(s) being evaluated by the clinical trial.\n\n- Treatment: One or more interventions are being evaluated for treating a disease, syndrome, or condition.\n- Prevention: One or more interventions are being assessed for preventing the development of a specific disease or health condition.\n- Diagnostic: One or more interventions are being evaluated for identifying a disease or health condition.\n- Supportive Care: One or more interventions are evaluated for maximizing comfort, minimizing side effects, or mitigating against a decline in the participant's health or function.\n- Screening: One or more interventions are assessed or examined for identifying a condition, or risk factors for a condition, in people who are not yet known to have the condition or risk factor.\n- Health Services Research: One or more interventions for evaluating the delivery, processes, management, organization, or financing of healthcare.\n- Basic Science: One or more interventions for examining the basic mechanism of action (for example, physiology or biomechanics of an intervention).\n- Device Feasibility: An intervention of a device product is being evaluated in a small clinical trial (generally fewer than 10 participants) to determine the feasibility of the product; or a clinical trial to test a prototype device for feasibility and not health outcomes. Such studies are conducted to confirm the design and operating specifications of a device before beginning a full clinical trial.\n- Other: None of the other options applies.",
