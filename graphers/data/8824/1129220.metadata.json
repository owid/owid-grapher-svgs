    "This measures how far people have traveled in paid robotaxi trips that are approved to operate in California.",
    "The calculation multiplies passengers by distance. So if 3 people share a 5-mile ride, that's 15 passenger-miles. For rides where passengers get in or out partway, each part of the trip is counted based on how many people were actually in the car.",
    "Excludes empty cars driving between pickups, test rides, and any non-passenger travel.",
    "Originally both Cruise and Waymo reported this data. Cruise stopped operating in late 2023 due to safety and regulatory issues. From 2024 onward, Waymo is the only company authorized to operate paid robotaxi services in California and the sole reporter of this data."
