  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",

    "Unit value represents the price of a physical unit of apparent consumption (such as a metric ton) in dollars. Apparent consumption itself is determined by the formula: Apparent Consumption = Production + Imports - Exports ± (Stock Change).",
    "For commodities that exist in a single physical form, like copper, a straightforward price series can estimate the unit value.",
    "However, for commodities like chromium, which encompass multiple forms (e.g., metal, ferroalloys, ore), weighted averages are used, with each form's price weighted by its contribution to total consumption.",
    "When no direct price series is available, unit values are derived using export, import, and production data.",
    "To ensure consistency over time, these values are reported in 1998 constant dollars, adjusted for inflation."
