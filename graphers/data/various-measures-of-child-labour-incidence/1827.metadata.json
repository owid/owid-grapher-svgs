    "additionalInfo": "Incidence of child labour in datasets for England and Italy is based on the percentage of children (aged 10-14) recorded as working at least one hour of work per week (thus defined as \"children in employment\"). Data for the United States is for children aged 10-13 only. Figures for the US have been calculated as the weighted-average of gender-specific incidences of labour, based on the male:female ratio (10-13 year-olds) from reported population figures.\n\nData for the global level is based on the definition of full-time child labour (which excludes children participating in light part-time work). World ILO-EPEAP data from 1950-1995 is based on children aged 10-14. World ILO-IPEC data from 2000-2012 broadens this definition to those aged 5-17. Estimates are based on census and national survey data."
