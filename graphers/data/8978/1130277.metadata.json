    "This data reflects the hierarchy rule, which requires that only the most serious offense in a case be counted. The descending order of violent crimes are homicide, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, followed by the property crimes of burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehicle theft. For example, if a robbery occurs during which a homicide takes place, only the homicide is counted.",
    "Examples are thefts of bicycles, motor vehicle parts and accessories, shoplifting, pickpocketing, or the stealing of any property or article that is not taken by force and violence or by fraud.",
    "Attempted larcenies are included. Embezzlement, confidence games, forgery, check fraud, etc., are excluded."
