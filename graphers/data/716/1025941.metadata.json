    "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures inflation — how the average prices of goods and services change over time.",
    "The CPI’s new cars index measures prices paid by consumers for newly purchased passenger cars, excluding trucks, SUVs, and fleet vehicles.",
    "It includes categories like subcompact, compact, intermediate, full-size, sporty, and luxury cars, based on vehicle classifications defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).",
    "Prices are sourced from J.D. Power transaction data, reflecting actual dealership sales across the U.S.",
    "When models change between years, quality adjustments are made for added features like improved safety or fuel efficiency.",
    "The index helps capture how market trends and vehicle upgrades affect the cost of new cars for consumers.",
    "The index uses a base period of 1982–84, which is set to 100. Later values show how much prices have changed since then."
