  "descriptionProcessing": "- Biologicals approved by the CBER have been extracted from the FDA's \"Purple Book\", which lists all licensed biological products.\n- CDER approvals (which include some biologics and all chemical drugs) come directly from the \"Compilation of CDER NME and New Biologic Approvals\" database, which is published by CDER.\n- This dataset only contains new drugs ([new chemical entities](#dod:new-chemical-entity) and biologics). We removed [biosimilars](#dod:biosimilar) and [generics](#dod:generic-drug) from the dataset, by excluding the \"biosimilar\" or \"interchangeable\" license types as well as products with a reference product listed.",
