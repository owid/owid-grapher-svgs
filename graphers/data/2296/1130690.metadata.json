    "Population is the most commonly used metric throughout Our World in Data. It is used directly to understand population growth over time, and indirectly to calculate per-capita indicators, making it easier to compare countries of different sizes.",
    "We construct this indicator by combining multiple sources covering different periods.\n  - HYDE v3.3 (2023): historical estimates from 10,000 BCE to 1799.\n  - Gapminder v7 (2022): for 1800-1949.\n  - UN World Population Prospects (2024): for 1950 onwards, including 2100 projections.\n  - Gapminder Systema Globalis (2023): additional source for former countries (Yugoslavia, USSR, etc.)",
    "Breaks in the data may occur at the boundaries between sources due to their methodological differences.",
    "You can read more about the sources and methodology in our [dedicated article](https://ourworldindata.org/population-sources). We also provide a table of sources showing the source we use for each country-year.",
    "We calculate geographical aggregates (continents, income groups, etc.) by summing individual country populations. For years before 1800, we rely directly on HYDE's values for continents to ensure historical consistency."

The data are used to assess progress toward global targets (currently the 95–95–95 targets and post-2025 goals).\n\nThe indicators and questions in this document are designed for use by national AIDS programmes and partners to assess the state of a country's HIV and AIDS response, and to measure progress towards achieving national HIV targets. Countries are encouraged to integrate these indicators and questions into their ongoing monitoring efforts and to report comprehensive national data through the Global AIDS Monitoring (GAM) process. In this way they will contribute to improving understanding of the global response to the HIV epidemic, including progress that has been made towards achieving the commitments and global targets set out in the new United Nations Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS: Ending Inequalities and Getting on Track to End AIDS by 2030, adopted in June 2021, and the linked Sustainable Development Goals.",
