  "descriptionFromProducer": "Item: Groundnut Oil\n\nDescription: Default composition: 244 Oil, groundnut\n\nMetric: Losses\n\nDescription: Amount of the commodity in question lost through wastage (waste) during the year at all stages between the level at which production is recorded and the household, i.e. storage and transportation. Losses occurring before and during harvest are excluded. Waste from both edible and inedible parts of the commodity occurring in the household is also excluded. Quantities lost during the transformation of primary commodities into processed products are taken into account in the assessment of respective extraction/conversion rates. Distribution wastes tend to be considerable in countries with hot humid climate, difficult transportation and inadequate storage or processing facilities. This applies to the more perishable foodstuffs, and especially to those which have to be transported or stored for a long time in a tropical climate. Waste is often estimated as a fixed percentage of availability, the latter being defined as production plus imports plus stock withdrawals. Source: FAO. 1986. The ICS users' manual.
