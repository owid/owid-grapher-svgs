  "descriptionShort": "[Internally displaced people (IDPs)](#dod:internally-displaced) who returned to their home (region), per 1,000 inhabitants of the country of origin. Only IDPs who returned during the calendar year are included.",
  "descriptionFromProducer": "- Returned [internally displaced people](#dod:internally-displaced) refers to those IDPs who were beneficiaries of UNHCR’s protection and assistance activities, and who returned to their areas of origin or habitual residence during the calendar year. In practice, however, operations may assist IDP returnees for longer periods.\n- Internally displaced persons (IDPs) are persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of, or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border. For the purposes of UNHCR’s statistics, this population includes only conflict-generated IDPs to whom the Office extends protection and/or assistance. The IDP population also includes people in an IDP-like situation.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The data collected by the UNHCR describes movement of refugees between individual regions. To calculate the total number of refugees in a region, we sum up the data from all origin countries. The same applies to calculating all refugees from one country of origin.\n- To calculate the number of refugees per 1,000 people in a country, we divide the number of refugees by the total population of the country and multiply by 1,000. The population estimates come from a long-run dataset [maintained by Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/population-sources).",

    "Population is the most commonly used metric throughout Our World in Data. It is used directly to understand population growth over time, and indirectly to calculate per-capita indicators, making it easier to compare countries of different sizes.",
    "We construct this indicator by combining multiple sources covering different periods.\n  - HYDE v3.3 (2023): historical estimates from 10,000 BCE to 1799.\n  - Gapminder v7 (2022): for 1800-1949.\n  - UN World Population Prospects (2024): for 1950 onwards, including 2100 projections.\n  - Gapminder Systema Globalis (2023): additional source for former countries (Yugoslavia, USSR, etc.)",
    "Breaks in the data may occur at the boundaries between sources due to their methodological differences.",
    "You can read more about the sources and methodology in our [dedicated article](https://ourworldindata.org/population-sources). We also provide a table of sources showing the source we use for each country-year.",
    "We calculate geographical aggregates (continents, income groups, etc.) by summing individual country populations. For years before 1800, we rely directly on HYDE's values for continents to ensure historical consistency."
