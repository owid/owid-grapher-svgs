  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS historical data:\n- Note on United States production: Production data for 1935 to the most recent year were from the MYB. Production data for 1935 to the most recent year represent the total helium content in Grade-A and crude helium that was recovered as a constituent of natural gas.\n- Note on global production: World production data for 1935–71 were from the MYB. World production data for 1972–2017 were from the MCS. World production data in 2018 was from the MYB, World production data for 1935 to the most recent year represent the summed quantity of total U.S. helium production and the total estimated production capacity of all other helium-producing countries. For 1935–62, world production is equal to U.S. production.\n\nNotes found in original USGS data:\n- Production in 2020. Production and reserves outside of the United States were estimated.\n- Production in 2021 is also estimated.\n- Production in 2021.\n- Also estimated in 2022.\n- Production in 2022. Estimated for Algeria, Australia, Qatar, and Russia.\n- Estimated production in 2023.\n\nNotes found in original BGS data:\n- Estimates.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",
