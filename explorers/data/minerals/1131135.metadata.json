  "descriptionShort": "Guano is the accumulated excrement of seabirds, bats, and seals. It is rich in nitrogen, phosphate and potassium, making it valuable as a fertilizer.",
  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original BGS data:\n- In addition to the countries listed, Indonesia and Nigeria are believed to produce phosphate rock.\n- In addition to the countries listed, Indonesia, Mali and Nigeria are believed to produce phosphate rock.\n- In addition to the countries listed, Indonesia and Uzbekistan are believed to produce phosphate rock.\n- In addition to the countries listed, Indonesia is believed to produce phosphate rock.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",
