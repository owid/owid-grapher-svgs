  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS historical data:\n- Note on United States production: Data are crude industrial garnet production. For 1944, data were withheld in order to avoid disclosing proprietary data. Production data were not available for 1924–27, 1935, 1937–42, and 1954–75. Sold or used data were substituted when production data were not available. Data are reported in the MR and the MYB.\n- Note on global production: World production data for 1900–12 and 1927–59 were not available. World production data for 1913–26 are reported in the MR and the MYB. World production data for 1960 to the most recent year are from the CDS and MCS.\n\nNotes found in original USGS data:\n- Production in 2020.\n- Production in 2021.\n- Production in 2022.\n- Estimated production in 2023.\n- Production in 2021 is also estimated.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",
