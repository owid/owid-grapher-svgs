  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS historical data:\n- Note on global production: Data represent the cobalt content of refined products or the cobalt content, recoverable cobalt content, or recovered cobalt content of mined ores, concentrates, or intermediate products depending on the producing country and year. Datum for 1900 was not available. Production estimates for the former Soviet Union are not included prior to 1961. Data for 1901–36 are from IC 8103. Data for 1937–97 are from the MYB. Data for 1998–2003, 2009, and 2011 are previously unpublished revisions. Data for 2004–08, 2010, and 2012 to the most recent year are from the MYB.\n\nNotes found in original USGS data:\n- Mine production in 2020.\n- Mine production in 2021.\n- Production in 2023.\n- Estimated production in 2024.\n- Production in 2021 is also estimated.\n- Overseas territory of France.\n\nNotes found in original BGS data:\n- Figures in this table relate where possible to cobalt recovered. The principal exceptions to this are Brazil, Democratic Republic of Congo and New Caledonia, the figures for which relate to ore raised.\n- There is frequently a considerable disparity between the cobalt content of ore raised and cobalt actually recovered.\n- Figures in this table relate where possible to cobalt recovered. The principal exceptions to this are Brazil and New Caledonia, the figures for which relate to cobalt in ore raised.\n- Figures in this table relate where possible to cobalt recovered. The principal exceptions to this are Brazil, Canada and New Caledonia, the figures for which relate to cobalt in ore raised.\n- Figures in this table relate either to cobalt recovered or to cobalt contained in ore raised. In many countries it is not clear whether cobalt that is known to exist in extracted ore is recovered.\n- Consequently, the figures in this table may relate either to cobalt recovered or to cobalt contained in ore raised.\n- In many countries it is not clear whether cobalt that is known to be present in the extracted ore is subsequently recovered, nor whether the reported figure is contained or recovered cobalt.\n- In addition to the countries listed, cobalt is contained within copper ores in Poland but this is not currently recovered.\n- Includes Co content of ores and residues shipped to overseas refineries including UK.\n- Metal and/or refined.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",
