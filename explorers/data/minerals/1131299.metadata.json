  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS data:\n- Production in 2020. Mine production in Russia is estimated in both years and refinery production in Canada is estimated in both years.\n- Production in 2021.\n- Production in 2022.\n- Production in 2023.\n- Estimated production in 2024.\n- Also estimated in 2022.\n- Estimated 2023.\n\nNotes found in original BGS data:\n- Figures relate to both primary and secondary refined copper, whether electrolytic or fire refined. Metal recovered from secondary remelting alone is excluded.\n- Figures relate to both primary and secondary refined copper, whether electrolytic or fire refined. Metal recovered from secondary materials by remelting alone is excluded.\n- In addition to the countries listed, Albania, Cyprus, Egypt and Myanmar produce refined copper.\n- In addition to the countries listed, Albania, Cyprus and Egypt produce refined copper.\n- In addition to the countries listed, Albania, Egypt and Mongolia produce refined copper.\n- In addition to the countries listed, Albania and Colombia produce refined copper.\n- Including alloys.\n- In 1990 the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) was reunited with the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Therefore, from 1991 these 2 countries are shown simply as \"Germany\".\n- Excluding data from August to December for the Republic of Croatia.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",
