  "descriptionShort": "Mineral processing involves the extraction, purification, or production of materials from ores, brines, or other raw sources, often as a byproduct or through specialized industrial processes.",
  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS historical data:\n- Note on global production: World production of lime was from the MYB and the MR. World production statistics were not available from 1900–62. All data for China are absent prior to 1983; conservative estimates for 1984–2001 were made by the USGS lime commodity specialist. Some data on Chinese lime production have become available allowing more accurate estimates for 2002 to the most recent year, which explains the dramatic increase in world production in 2002. There are no reliable data for lime production for many of the countries of the former Soviet Union. Starting in 2010, total world production data have been rounded to two significant digits to reflect the uncertainty associated with the amount of estimated data.\n\nNotes found in original USGS data:\n- Production in 2020. Includes quicklime, hydrated lime, and refractory dead-burned dolomite.\n- Production in 2021. Includes quicklime, hydrated lime, and refractory dead-burned dolomite. Data for Belgium and Italy include hydraulic lime.\n- Production in 2022. Includes quicklime, hydrated lime, and refractory dead-burned dolomite. Data for Belgium and Italy include hydraulic lime.\n- Production in 2023.\n- Estimated production in 2024.\n- Includes hydraulic lime.\n- Only countries that produced 1 million tons of lime or more are listed separately.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",
