  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS historical data:\n- Note on United States production: Production data are from the MR and the MYB.\n- Note on global production: World production represents the world production of iron ore, iron ore concentrates, and iron ore agglomerates. For 1913–22, world production is reported as “production in principal countries.” In 2015, production data were adjusted for China for 2010 forward to reflect the usable ore grade consistent with reporting standards based on global averages, derived from data reported by China.\n\nNotes found in original USGS data:\n- Production in 2020.\n- Production in 2021.\n- Production in 2022.\n- Production in 2023.\n- Estimated production in 2024.\n- Estimated 2023.\n\nNotes found in original BGS data:\n- Nickeliferous iron ore.\n- In addition to the countries listed, Vietnam is believed to produce iron ore.\n- Including micaceous iron oxide.\n- Including beneficiated and direct shipping ore.\n- Including by-product iron ore.\n- From nickel plant waste.\n- Including iron sand.\n- Production from stockpiles.\n- Including manganiferous iron ore.\n- Used as aggregate in the construction industry.\n- Including by-product magnetite.\n- The Florence mine near Egremont, Cumbria closed in 2008. The mine produced high-grade hematite for foundry uses, mineral specimens and jewellery. The mine was also a tourist attraction.\n- In 1990 the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) was reunited with the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Therefore, from 1991 these 2 countries are shown simply as \"Germany\".\n- In 1980 Rhodesia was renamed Zimbabwe.\n- Excluding data from August to December for the Republic of Croatia.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",
