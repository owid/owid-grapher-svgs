  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS historical data:\n- Note on United States production: Production is given for three time periods (1932–37, 1969–83, and 1988–2005). Data for the first and last time periods were from the salient statistics table and(or) a production table in the MYB. Data from 1969–83 were from the MFP. Production data for other time periods were withheld because the data were proprietary.\n- Note on global production: World production data for 1960–75, are reported in the world mine production table of the CDS. Data for 1976 to the most recent year are reported in the world production table of the MYB. Excludes production in the United States for 2006 to the most recent year.\n\nNotes found in original USGS data:\n- Production in 2020. Excludes U.S. production. China and Iran also produce crude iodine, but output is not officially reported, and available information was inadequate to make reliable estimates of output.\n- Estimated production in 2021.  Excludes U.S. production. China also produces crude iodine, but output is not officially reported, and available information was inadequate to make reliable estimates of output.\n- Estimated production in 2022.  Excludes U.S. production. Reported production for Indonesia.\n- Production in 2023.\n- Estimated production in 2024.\n- Reported production in 2021.\n- Reported in 2022.\n- Excludes China.\n- Excludes U.S. Production.\n\nNotes found in original BGS data:\n- Exports.\n- Estimates.\n- Years ended 20 March following that stated.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",
