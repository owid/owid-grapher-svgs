  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS data:\n- Crude iron ore, million metric tons. For Australia, Joint Ore Reserves Committee-compliant or equivalent reserves were 23 billion tons of crude ore and 10 billion tons of iron content.\n- That part of the reserve base that could be economically extracted or produced at the time of determination. The term “reserves” need not signify that extraction facilities are in place and operative. Reserves include only recoverable materials; thus, terms such as “extractable reserves” and “recoverable reserves” are redundant and are not a part of this classification system. Additional information is available in Appendix C of the Mineral Commodity Summaries, included in this data release, for resource and reserve definitions and information concerning data sources.\n- Crude ore, million metric tons. For Australia, Joint Ore Reserves Committee-compliant or equivalent reserves were 23 billion tons of crude ore and 10 billion tons of iron content.\n- Crude Ore, million metric tons.\n- Reserves of the mineral commodity in the subject country.\n- Crude iron ore, million metric tons.\n- Crude ore, million metric tons.\n- Crude iron ore, million metric tons. For Ukraine, reserves consist of the A and B categories of the Soviet reserves classification system.\n-  For Ukraine, reserves consist of the A and B categories of the Soviet reserves classification system. Crude ore, million metric tons.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",
