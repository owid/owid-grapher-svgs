  "descriptionShort": "Based on mined, rather than [refined](#dod:refined-production), production.",
  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS historical data:\n- Note on global production: World production represents mine production and is reported as recoverable nickel contained in the ore mined. Where actual mine output was not available, data related to a more highly processed form were used to indicate the minimum magnitude of mine output. In 1953, production data for countries once comprising the former Soviet Union were included for the first time. Data are sourced as follows: 1900–29, MS50; and 1930 to the most recent year, MYB.\n\nNotes found in original USGS data:\n- Production in 2020.\n- Production in 2021.\n- Production in 2022.\n- Production in 2023.\n- Estimated production in 2024.\n- Also estimated in 2022.\n- Estimated 2023.\n- Overseas Territory of France.\n\nNotes found in original BGS data:\n- Refined nickel and nickel in oxide and salts plus nickel in matte and concentrate exported.\n- Ni and Co content of sulphide slurry and oxide.\n- Ni and Co content.\n- Ni content of ferro-nickel.\n- In 1990 the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) was reunited with the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Therefore, from 1991 these 2 countries are shown simply as \"Germany\".\n- In addition some nickel is produced as a by-product of a talc operation. The amount is negligible.\n- Including the nickel content of ferro-nickel and other smelter products.\n- Ni content of nickel speiss.\n- Nickel content of refinery products.\n- Refined nickel and nickel in matte.\n- Includes metal and metal content of sulphate and concentrates.\n- In 1980 Rhodesia was renamed Zimbabwe.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",
