  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS historical data:\n- Note on global production: World production data for 1938 to the most recent year were from the MYB. World production data for 1938–87 represent the total quantity of natural industrial diamonds that were produced annually throughout the world. World production data for 1988–2000 represent the total quantity of natural and synthetic industrial diamonds that were produced annually throughout the world. World production data for 1900–37 were not available. Production data for the United States were not included in world production for 1986–94. There is a large increase in the world production quantity between 2003 and 2004 because Chinese synthetic production data has been corrected from 2004 to present using data provided by industry sources. There is a second large increase in the world production quantity between 2012 and 2013 because Chinese synthetic production data has been corrected again from 2013 to present using data provided by industry sources.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",

For many of the commodities, data are reported as far back as 1900.\nThe data was compiled primarily from publications of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the U.S. Bureau of Mines (USBM). The principal references are the annual Minerals Yearbook (MYB) publication and its predecessor, Mineral Resources of the United States (MR). Other USGS and USBM publications used as references included: Statistical Compendium (SC), Metal Prices in the United States Through 1991 (MP91), Metal Prices in the United States Through 1998 (MP98), Metal Prices in the United States Through 2010, MCS and its predecessor Commodity Data Summaries (CDS), Minerals Facts and Problems (MFP), and various USBM Information Circulars. In some cases, USGS mineral commodity specialists added previously unpublished or recently revised data to the historical statistics series.",
