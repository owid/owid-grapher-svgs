  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS historical data:\n- Note on global production: World production data are for mine production of vanadium. Data are from the MR and MYB for 1912-22, 1925, 1927-31, 1934-43, 1945-47, and 1998 to the most recent year, the CDS for 1960-77, and the MCS for 1978-84 and 1990-97. Data were not available for 1901-11, 1923-24, and 1948-59. World production was interpolated to two significant figures for 1926, 1932-33, 1944, and 1985-89. World production data for 1927-31 and 1997-99 do not contain U.S. production.\n\nNotes found in original USGS data:\n- Production in 2020.\n- Production in 2021.\n- Production in 2023.\n- Estimated production in 2024.\n- Estimated 2023.\n- Also estimated in 2022.\n\nNotes found in original BGS data:\n- This table includes vanadium in slag products but excludes vanadium recovered as a byproduct of the refining and burning of heavy oils.\n- This table includes vanadium in slag products but excludes vanadium recovered as a by-product of the refining and burning of heavy oils.\n- Estimated V content of slag exported only.\n- Tonnes of vanadium pentoxide.\n- Figure includes six months product for 1975.\n- Includes V content of slag.\n- Recoverable vanadium.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",
