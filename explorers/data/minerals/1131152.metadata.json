  "descriptionShort": "Based on mined, rather than [refined](#dod:refined-production), production. Measured in tonnes.",
  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS historical data:\n- Note on United States production: U.S. production data collection and reporting did not start for construction sand and gravel until 1902. Before 1902, sand was included with stone and included only silica sand for glassmaking. Construction and industrial sand and gravel production were reported together in the salient statistics table in the MR and the MYB through 1958 and were split between “commercial” and “government” (State, county, municipalities, and Federal). Categories were split between construction and industrial according to the following guidelines: Construction sand included building, paving, railroad ballast, and other (excluding ground sand). The reporting of gravel production prior to 1959 did not indicate any industrial applications, therefore the assumption is made that all gravel production data were for construction applications. After 1958, some gravel was used for industrial applications, such as filtration, ferrosilicon, and nonmetallic flux for sulfur production. Industrial sand includes sand for glass, molding, grinding and polishing (also blast sand), fire or furnace, engine, and filter (ground sand is included in the “other” category and is separated out for inclusion with industrial). Construction and industrial sand and gravel statistics were reported separately in a combined chapter starting with the 1959 MYB and later in separate chapters starting with the 1988 MYB.\n- Note on global production: World production data for sand and gravel (construction) are not available for most of the period for 1902 to the most recent year owing to the lack of data collection by many of the producing countries. World production data are available for 1969–72, 1974, and 1975 from the MCS.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",
