  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS historical data:\n- Note on United States production: Production data for 1900 to the most recent year were from the MR and the MYB. Production data for 1900–40 were equal to shipment data. Production data for 1900–20 represent the summed weights of talc and soapstone that were produced and sold in the United States. Production data for 1921–40 represent the summed weights of talc, soapstone, and pyrophyllite that were produced and sold in the United States. Production data for 1941–71 represent the summed weights of crude talc, soapstone, and pyrophyllite that were produced from domestic mines. Production data for 1972–90 represent the summed weights of crude talc and pyrophyllite that were produced from domestic mines. After 1990, production data only represent the quantities of crude talc that were produced from domestic mines. After 1990, production data for pyrophyllite were withheld because they were proprietary.\n- Note on global production: World production data for 1904 to the most recent year were from the MR and the MYB. World production data for 1904–12 represent the summed weights of all talc and soapstone materials that were produced annually throughout the world. World production data for 1913 to the most recent year represent the summed weights of all talc, pyrophyllite, soapstone, steatite, and other unspecified talc-related materials that were produced annually throughout the world.\n\nNotes found in original USGS data:\n- Production in 2021. U.S. production is estimated.\n- Estimated production in 2022. Production is reported for the United States, Finland, Republic of Korea, Pakistan, South Africa, and Turkey.\n- Reported in 2022.\n- Reported production in 2021.\n- Reported.\n- Production in 2023.\n- Estimated production in 2024.\n- Excludes U.S. production of pyrophyllite.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",
