Russia is estimated.\n- Production in 2023.\n- Estimated production in 2024.\n- Production in 2021 is also estimated.\n\nNotes found in original BGS data:\n- Figures for metal production are only given for countries where recovery is thought to be based predominantly on domestic materials or on imported materials which have not been recorded as mine production elsewhere in the table.\n- In addition to the countries listed, Bulgaria, China, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Philippines are believed to produce platinum group metals.\n- Wherever possible, figures relate to quantities of platinum group metals thought to be recovered from ores originating in the country stated.\n- In addition to the countries listed, Bulgaria, China, Ethiopia, Indonesia and Philippines are believed to produce platinum group metals.\n- In addition to the production listed, concentrates produced in Spain, and possibly other countries, are believed to be processed in China to recover platinum group metals.\n- Platinum group metals; all forms.\n- South Africa thought to be the only country to produce osmium, however data is unavailable.\n- Platinum metals content of concentrates (produced from Ni-Cu ores), residues and matte exported.\n- Sales from mine production and stocks.\n- Recovered by refineries from domestic platinum, gold and copper ores.\n- Excluding data from August to December for the Republic of Croatia.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",
