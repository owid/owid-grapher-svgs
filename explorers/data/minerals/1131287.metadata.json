  "descriptionShort": "Production of [bismuth](#dod:bismuth) as a share of global bismuth production. Based on mined, rather than [refined](#dod:refined-production), production.",
  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS historical data:\n- Note on United States production: Domestic primary bismuth production ceased in 1997. Primary bismuth production data are withheld in order to avoid disclosing proprietary data. Secondary production data, generally estimated at less than 5% of consumption, are not included in this data series.\n- Note on global production: Data are the bismuth content of world mine production. Data were not available prior to 1912 or for 1922–36. Data for 1912–21 and 1972 and later exclude U.S. production. Data are not available from 2014 to the most recent year. Data are from the MR and the MYB.\n\nNotes found in original BGS data:\n- Production for some countries may include bismuth produced from imported ores but it is thought that any resulting duplication is insignificant in the countries shown.\n- The figures in this table are in some instances derived from reported bismuth content of refined and impure metal plus recoverable in ores and concentrates exported.\n- In addition to the countries listed, the Republic of Korea may produce bismuth but data are confidential.\n- In addition to the countries listed, Brazil is believed to produce bismuth.\n- Including Bi content of bullion and concentrates exported.\n- Exports of metal have always been higher than mine production in recent years.\n- Excluding data from August to December for the Republic of Croatia.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",

For many of the commodities, data are reported as far back as 1900.\nThe data was compiled primarily from publications of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the U.S. Bureau of Mines (USBM). The principal references are the annual Minerals Yearbook (MYB) publication and its predecessor, Mineral Resources of the United States (MR). Other USGS and USBM publications used as references included: Statistical Compendium (SC), Metal Prices in the United States Through 1991 (MP91), Metal Prices in the United States Through 1998 (MP98), Metal Prices in the United States Through 2010, MCS and its predecessor Commodity Data Summaries (CDS), Minerals Facts and Problems (MFP), and various USBM Information Circulars.
