  "descriptionShort": "Production of refined [bismuth](#dod:bismuth) as a share of global refined bismuth production. The amounts of [refined](#dod:refined-production) and raw materials differ because refining removes impurities and adjusts the composition to meet specific standards.",
  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS historical data:\n- Note on global production: Data are the bismuth production from world refineries. Data exclude U.S. production, which ended in 1997. Bismuth is produced as a byproduct of mining and processing other metals, mainly lead and tungsten. Not all mines that produce ores containing recoverable bismuth report their production. Therefore, some bismuth production may only be accounted for at the refinery level.\n\nNotes found in original USGS data:\n- Production amount estimated in the year 2021. Data for Laos is reported.\n- Production in 2023.\n- Estimated production in 2024.\n- Reported production in 2021.\n- Reported quantity in 2022.\n- Reported.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",
