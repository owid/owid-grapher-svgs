  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS historical data:\n- Note on United States production: Production data for 1956–73 and 1978 to the most recent year were from the CDS and the MCS. For 1974–77, production data were from the MYB. Production data were reported in two significant figures. Production data for 1956 to the most recent year represent the estimated germanium content of germanium materials that were produced annually from domestic refineries.\n- Note on global production: World production data for 1957 to the most recent year represent the total quantity of germanium metal that was produced annually from refineries throughout the world. Data are from the MCS and MYB.\n\nNotes found in original USGS data:\n- Estimated production in 2020. World total excludes U.S. production.\n- Estimated production in 2021. World total excludes U.S. production.\n\nNotes found in original BGS data:\n- Significant quantities of germanium are also believed to be recovered from imported or domestic material in France, Germany, Russia and to a lesser extent in Italy.\n- Significant quantities of germanium are also believed to be recovered from imported or domestic material in Belgium, France, Fed Republic of Germany and to a lesser extent in Italy.\n- Significant quantities of germanium are also believed to be recovered from imported or domestic material in Belgium, France, Germany and to a lesser extent in Italy.\n- Germanium is also believed to be recovered from imported or domestic material in Belgium, Canada, Russia and Ukraine.\n- Germanium is also believed to be recovered from imported or domestic material in Belgium, Canada and Ukraine.\n- Germanium is also believed to be recovered from imported or domestic material in Belgium, Canada, Germany, Japan and Ukraine.\n- Including production of secondary metal.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",
