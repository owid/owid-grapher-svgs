  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS historical data:\n- Note on global production: World production data for 1964–68 were not available. World production data for 1969 to the most recent year represent the tantalum content in tantalum-bearing ores and mineral concentrates that were produced from mines throughout the world. World production data for 1969 to the most recent year were from the MYB.\n\nNotes found in original USGS data:\n- Production in 2020 in metric tons of contained tantalum.\n- Production in 2021 in metric tons of contained tantalum.\n- Production in 2022 in metric tons of contained tantalum. Production is estimated for all countries except for Australia.\n- Production in 2023.\n- Estimated production in 2024.\n- Production in 2021 is also estimated.\n- Also estimated in 2022.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",
