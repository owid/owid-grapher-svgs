  "descriptionShort": "Production of [fluorspar](#dod:fluorspar) as a share of global fluorspar production. Based on mined, rather than [refined](#dod:refined-production), production.",
  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS historical data:\n- Note on United States production: Production data for 1900–96 represent the quantities of fluorspar that were produced and shipped annually within the United States. Data were from the MR and the MYB. For 1997 to the most recent year, a small quantity of fluorspar was produced and shipped, but statistical data were not available.\n- Note on global production: World production data for 1913 to the most recent year represent the total estimated quantities of fluorspar that were produced annually throughout the world. Data were from the MR and the MYB.\n\nNotes found in original USGS data:\n- Production in 2020. Production from China is as reported by China's Ministry of Natural Resources. Likely excludes production from operations that did not meet the Government's minimum mining and processing requirements. The China Non-Metallic Minerals Industry Association estimated that actual production was closer to 6 million tons.\n- Production in 2021.\n- Production in 2022.\n- Production in 2023.\n- Estimated production in 2024.\n- Reported.\n\nNotes found in original BGS data:\n- In addition, the USA produced the following amounts of fluorspar equivalent in fluorosilicic acid derived from processing phosphate rock ('000 t): 2013: 134; 2014: 131; 2015:114; 2016: 105; 2017: 72.\n- In addition to the countries listed, Bulgaria is believed to produce fluorspar.\n- In addition, the USA produced the following amounts of fluorspar equivalent in fluorosilicic acid derived from processing phosphate rock ('000 t): 1997: 121; 1998: 118; 1999: 122; 2000: 119; 2001: 93.\n- In addition, the USA produced the following amounts of fluorspar equivalent in fluorosilicic acid derived from processing phosphate rock ('000 t): 1998: 118; 1999: 122; 2000: 119; 2001: 104; 2002: 92.\n- In addition to the countries listed, Bulgaria and Tajikistan are believed to produce fluorspar.\n- In addition, the USA produced the following amounts of fluorspar equivalent in fluorosilicic acid derived from processing phosphate rock ('000 t): 1999: 122; 2000: 119; 2001: 104; 2002: 92; 2003: 94.\n- In addition, the USA produced the following amounts of fluorspar equivalent in fluorosilicic acid derived from processing phosphate rock ('000 t): 2000: 119; 2001: 104; 2002: 92; 2003: 94; 2004: 95.\n- In addition, the USA produced the following amounts of fluorspar equivalent in fluorosilicic acid derived from processing phosphate rock ('000 t): 2001: 104; 2002: 92; 2003: 94; 2004: 95; 2005: 86.\n- In addition, the USA produced the following amounts of fluorspar equivalent in fluorosilicic acid derived from processing phosphate rock ('000 t): 2002: 92; 2003: 94; 2004: 90; 2005: 86; 2006: 70.\n- In addition, the USA produced the following amounts of fluorspar equivalent in fluorosilicic acid derived from processing phosphate rock ('000 t): 2003: 94; 2004: 90; 2005: 86; 2006: 70; 2007: 83.\n- In addition, the USA produced the following amounts of fluorspar equivalent in fluorosilicic acid derived from processing phosphate rock ('000 t): 2004: 90; 2005: 86; 2006: 70; 2007: 83; 2008: 92.\n- In addition, the USA produced the following amounts of fluorspar equivalent in fluorosilicic acid derived from processing phosphate rock ('000 t): 2005: 86; 2006: 70; 2007: 83; 2008: 92; 2009: 97.\n- In addition, the USA produced the following amounts of fluorspar equivalent in fluorosilicic acid derived from processing phosphate rock ('000 t): 2009: 114; 2010:128; 2011: 124; 2012: 130; 2013: 134.\n- In addition, the USA produced the following amounts of fluorspar equivalent in fluorosilicic acid derived from processing phosphate rock ('000 t): ; 2012: 130; 2013: 134; 2014: 131; 2015:114; 2016: 105.\n- Including beneficiated and directly shipped material.\n- In 1990 the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) was reunited with the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Therefore, from 1991 these 2 countries are shown simply as \"Germany\".\n- Including fluorspar recovered from old lead and zinc mine dumps.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",

The principal references are the annual Minerals Yearbook (MYB) publication and its predecessor, Mineral Resources of the United States (MR). Other USGS and USBM publications used as references included: Statistical Compendium (SC), Metal Prices in the United States Through 1991 (MP91), Metal Prices in the United States Through 1998 (MP98), Metal Prices in the United States Through 2010, MCS and its predecessor Commodity Data Summaries (CDS), Minerals Facts and Problems (MFP), and various USBM Information Circulars.
