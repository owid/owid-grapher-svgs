  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS historical data:\n- Note on United States production: Production data for lithium refers to lithium contained in material produced or shipped from mines and brine operations in the United States. Production data for 1940–54 include both gross tons of lithium minerals and compound production and Li2O content of these products. Li2O contains 46.46 percent lithium; this information was used to determine lithium content for those years. Because production data for 1940–54 included dilithium sodium phosphate, the average lithium content of domestic production varied from 2.50 percent to 5.20 percent for the period. Most lithium ores average about 2.00 percent and, and dilithium sodium phosphate contains about 10.5 percent lithium.\n- Note on global production: World production data are in metric tons of gross product of lithium minerals and brine. Since 1967, lithium production was reported as ore and ore concentrate from mines and lithium carbonate from brine deposits. Since 2000, lithium production was reported as ore concentrate from mines and lithium carbonate from brine deposits, as lithium content, and as lithium carbonate equivalent. World production data for 1966–67 do not include data from Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) and some other African countries. Zimbabwe was by far the largest producer at the time. After 1954, world production does not include U.S. production. Data were not available for 1900–24.\n\nNotes found in original USGS data:\n- Production in 2020, excluding U.S. production.\n- Production in 2021, excluding U.S. production.\n- Production in 2022, excluding U.S. production. Estimated for Brazil, Canada, China, Portugal, Zimbabwe, and other countries.\n- Production in 2023.\n- Estimated production in 2024.\n- Production in 2021 is also estimated.\n- Also estimated in 2022.\n- Estimated 2023.\n- Excludes U.S. production.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",

The principal references are the annual Minerals Yearbook (MYB) publication and its predecessor, Mineral Resources of the United States (MR). Other USGS and USBM publications used as references included: Statistical Compendium (SC), Metal Prices in the United States Through 1991 (MP91), Metal Prices in the United States Through 1998 (MP98), Metal Prices in the United States Through 2010, MCS and its predecessor Commodity Data Summaries (CDS), Minerals Facts and Problems (MFP), and various USBM Information Circulars.
