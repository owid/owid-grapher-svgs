  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS historical data:\n- Note on global production: World mine production data are from the MR and the MYB. Mercury production data for the United States, primarily as a byproduct of gold, copper, and zinc mining, were withheld from world mine production data for 1993–97 and were not available for 1998 to the most recent year.\n\nNotes found in original USGS data:\n- Production in 2020; world total excludes U.S. production.\n- Estimated production in 2021; world total excludes U.S. production.\n- Production in 2023.\n- Estimated production in 2024.\n- Na for 2023.\n- Excludes U.S. production.\n\nNotes found in original BGS data:\n- Several countries are believed to have unrecorded production of mercury from copper electrowinning processes.\n- Several countries are believed to have unrecorded production of mercury from copper electrowinning processes and by recovery from effluents.\n- From copper solvent extraction and electrowinning processes.\n- BGS estimates, based on net exports.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",

      "description": "Information on mineral commodities, including production and unit value (the real and nominal price in U.S. dollars of a metric ton of apparent consumption). For many of the commodities, data are reported as far back as 1900.\nThe data was compiled primarily from publications of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the U.S. Bureau of Mines (USBM). The principal references are the annual Minerals Yearbook (MYB) publication and its predecessor, Mineral Resources of the United States (MR). Other USGS and USBM publications used as references included: Statistical Compendium (SC), Metal Prices in the United States Through 1991 (MP91), Metal Prices in the United States Through 1998 (MP98), Metal Prices in the United States Through 2010, MCS and its predecessor Commodity Data Summaries (CDS), Minerals Facts and Problems (MFP), and various USBM Information Circulars. In some cases, USGS mineral commodity specialists added previously unpublished or recently revised data to the historical statistics series.",
