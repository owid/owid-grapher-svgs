  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS data:\n- Production in 2020. U.S. data are rounded to one significant digit to avoid disclosing company proprietary data.\n- Estimated production in 2021.\n- Estimated production in 2022.\n- Production in 2023.\n- Estimated production in 2024.\n- Reported.\n- Data are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand tons to avoid disclosing company proprietary data.\n- Excludes U.S. production.\n\nNotes found in original BGS data:\n- In this table the term 'zirconium minerals' is understood to mean zircon, unless otherwise stated.\n- Including caldasite rock containing zircon and baddeleyite.\n- Conservative BGS estimates, based on exports.\n- Including baddeleyite.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",
