  "descriptionShort": "Mineral processing involves the extraction, purification, or production of materials from ores, brines, or other raw sources, often as a byproduct or through specialized industrial processes.",
  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original BGS data:\n- Data relate to refined nickel plus the nickel content of ferro-nickel and nickel oxide.\n- Data relate to refined nickel plus the nickel content of ferro-nickel, nickel oxide and nickel salts.\n- In addition to the countries listed, the USA produces some nickel as a refinery by-product.\n- Data relate to refined nickel plus the nickel content of ferro-nickel, nickel oxide and nickel salts. It does not include nickel content of nickel hydroxide cake or nickel matte as these are further refined elsewhere.\n- Data relate to refined nickel plus the nickel content of ferro-nickel, nickel oxide, nickel salts, nickel matte and nickel pig iron. It does not include nickel content of nickel hydroxide cake.\n- Shipments of ferro-nickel (Ni content).\n- In 1990 the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) was reunited with the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Therefore, from 1991 these 2 countries are shown simply as \"Germany\".\n- This figure may include nickel content of matte and/or nickel content of nickel pig iron.\n- Excluding production from domestic ores.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",
