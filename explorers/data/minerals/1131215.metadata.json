  "descriptionShort": "Mineral [reserves](#dod:mineral-reserve) are resources that have been evaluated and can be mined economically with current technologies.",
  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS data:\n- For Australia, Joint Ore Reserves Committee-compliant or equivalent reserves for ilmenite and rutile were estimated to be 37 million and 9.2 million tons, respectively.\n- That part of the reserve base that could be economically extracted or produced at the time of determination. The term “reserves” need not signify that extraction facilities are in place and operative. Reserves include only recoverable materials; thus, terms such as “extractable reserves” and “recoverable reserves” are redundant and are not a part of this classification system. Additional information is available in Appendix C of the Mineral Commodity Summaries, included in this data release, for resource and reserve definitions and information concerning data sources.\n- For Australia, Joint Ore Reserves Committee-compliant or equivalent reserves were estimated to be 43 million tons for ilmenite and 11 million tons for rutile, TiO2 content. Reserves for Australia, Canada, China, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, South Africa, and “Other countries” were revised based on company and Government reports.\n- For Australia, Joint Ore Reserves Committee-compliant or equivalent reserves were estimated to be 43 million tons for ilmenite and 11 million tons for rutile, respectively, TiO2 content.\n- Reserves of the mineral commodity in the subject country.\n- Reserves for Australia, Canada, China, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, South Africa, and “Other countries” were revised based on company and Government reports.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",
