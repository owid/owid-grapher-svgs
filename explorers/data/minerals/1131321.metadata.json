  "descriptionShort": "Based on mined, rather than [refined](#dod:refined-production), production.",
  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS historical data:\n- Note on United States production: U.S. manganese production data include the amount of contained manganese in manganese ore (containing 35 percent or more manganese) and ferruginous manganese ore (containing less than 35 percent, but not less than 10 percent manganese) mined in the United States. The manganese contained in manganiferous iron ore (containing less than 10 percent manganese) is excluded from production. Manganiferous iron ores are sought for their iron units, and the contained manganese is an associated minor constituent. Because manganese is not directly recycled to a great degree, production means primary production, exclusive of the amounts of manganese circulating in recycled steel scrap. Production data for 1900–50 was extracted from Materials Survey—Manganese. For 1951–90, the data was extracted from IC 9399, and for 1991 to the most recent year, the information was reported in the MYB series. Manganese ore has not been produced in the United States since 1979.\n- Note on global production: World mine production data report contained manganese of world manganese mine production. From 1900 to 1950, the reported values were calculated by multiplying gross weight (adjusted to metric tons) reported in Materials Survey—Manganese (U.S. Bureau of Mines and U.S. Geological Survey, 1952) by 0.45 (45 percent). The 45-percent-content estimate was used for consistency with what appears to have been used for the oldest years given in Mineral Facts and Problems. From 1951 to 1963, the reported values were calculated by multiplying the gross weight (adjusted to metric tons) reported in MYB series by 0.45. From 1964 to 1979, the reported values were taken directly from the values (adjusted to metric tons) reported in the MFP. For 1980 to the most recent year, the reported values were taken directly from the values published in MYB world production table data series. In more recent years, the manganese content figure has been closer to 35 percent.\n\nNotes found in original USGS data:\n- Production in 2020.\n- Production in 2021 - thousand metric tons, manganese content.\n- Production in 2022 - thousand metric tons, manganese content.\n- Production in 2023.\n- Estimated production in 2024.\n- Estimated 2023.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",

For many of the commodities, data are reported as far back as 1900.\nThe data was compiled primarily from publications of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the U.S. Bureau of Mines (USBM). The principal references are the annual Minerals Yearbook (MYB) publication and its predecessor, Mineral Resources of the United States (MR). Other USGS and USBM publications used as references included: Statistical Compendium (SC), Metal Prices in the United States Through 1991 (MP91), Metal Prices in the United States Through 1998 (MP98), Metal Prices in the United States Through 2010, MCS and its predecessor Commodity Data Summaries (CDS), Minerals Facts and Problems (MFP), and various USBM Information Circulars. In some cases, USGS mineral commodity specialists added previously unpublished or recently revised data to the historical statistics series.",
