  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS data:\n- Production in 2020 in thousand metric tons of contained TiO2. U.S. rutile production data are included with ilmenite and are rounded to the nearest 100,000 tons to avoid disclosing company proprietary data. In Canada, Madagascar, and South Africa, ilmenite mine production is primarily used to produce titaniferous slag.\n- Production in 2021 in thousand metric tons of contained TiO2.\n- Production in 2023.\n- Estimated production in 2024.\n- U.S. rutile production and reserves data are included with ilmenite.\n\nNotes found in original BGS data:\n- In 1992 Canada produced 753 000 tonnes of slag (80% TiO2).\n- In 1995 South Africa produced 988 000 tonnes of slag (85% TiO2) and Canada produced 816 000 tonnes of slag (80% TiO2).\n- Some ilmenite is converted to synthetic rutile in Australia, India, Japan, Taiwan and USA.\n- The figures in this table refer to gross tonnage of titanium concentrates.\n- In 2008 South Africa produced an estimated 1 200 000 tonnes of slag (85% TiO2) and Canada produced an estimated 1 110 000 tonnes of slg (80-95% TiO2).\n- In 2009 South Africa produced an estimated 1 850 000 tonnes of slag (85% TiO2) and Canada produced an estimated 800 000 tonnes of slag (80-95% TiO2).\n- In 2010 South Africa produced an estimated xxxxx tonnes of slag (85% TiO2) and Canada produced an estimated xxxxx tonnes of slag (80-95% TiO2).\n- Some ilmenite is converted to synthetic rutile in Australia, India, Japan and USA.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",
