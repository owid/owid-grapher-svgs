  "descriptionShort": "Production of [gallium](#dod:gallium) as a share of global gallium production. Mineral processing involves the extraction, purification, or production of materials from ores, brines, or other raw sources, often as a byproduct or through specialized industrial processes.",
  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS data:\n- Production in 2020.\n- Reported production in 2021.\n- Production in 2021.\n- Estimated in 2022 also.\n- Production in 2022. Estimated for Japan, Republic of Korea, Russia, and Other Countries.\n- Estimated from China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association article. Source: Argus Media Group, Argus Non-Ferrous Markets. .\n- Production in 2023.\n- Estimated production in 2024.\n- Other countries thought to still have primary low-purity gallium production capacity include Germany, Hungary, and Kazakhstan. .\n- Other countries estimated to still have primary low-purity gallium production capacity include Germany, Hungary, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine.\n\nNotes found in original BGS data:\n- Accurate data for gallium is difficult to obtain because it is produced only as a by-product of bauxite or zinc processing using proprietary techniques. As a consequence, this table may not be complete.\n- In addition to the above primary production, there is also believed to be significant production of refined gallium from scrap recycling.\n- In addition to the countries listed, the Republic of Korea and Ukraine may produce primary gallium.\n- Lower grade production is often subsequently refined to higher grade material which complicates the collection of data as double counting is a significant risk.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",
