  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS historical data:\n- Note on United States production: Production data were for contained magnesium oxide for magnesium compounds in the United States. For 1900–57, production data for magnesium compounds include dead-burned magnesia, caustic-calcined magnesia, magnesium carbonate, magnesium chloride, magnesium hydroxide, and magnesium sulfate. For 1900–57, data were from the MR and the MYB. For 1958–2003, production data were contained magnesium oxide for magnesium compounds produced from brucite, dolomite, magnesite, olivine, and seawater and brines. For 1958–98, data were from the SC, and for 1999 to the most recent year, data were from the MCS. In prior years, the MCS reported data in magnesium content. MCS data were converted to magnesium oxide content from magnesium content using a factor of 0.603. Starting in 2017, data in the MCS were reported as contained magnesium oxide.\n- Note on global production: World production data are in terms of metric tons gross weight of magnesite (magnesium carbonate) produced. Data were from the MR and the MYB. Data were not available for 1900–12.\n\nNotes found in original USGS data:\n- Estimated production in 2020. World total excludes U.S. production. Data in thousand metric tons of contained magnesium oxide (MgO). Reported as magnesium content through Mineral Commodity Summaries 2016. Based on input from consumers, producers, and others involved in the industry, reporting magnesium compound data in terms of contained magnesium oxide was determined to be more useful than reporting in terms of magnesium content. Calculations were made using the following magnesium oxide (MgO) contents: magnesite, 47.8%; magnesium chloride, 42.3%; magnesium hydroxide, 69.1%; and magnesium sulfate, 33.5%.\n- Estimated production in 2021. World total excludes U.S. production.\n- Production in 2023.\n- Estimated production in 2024.\n- Reported.\n- Excludes U.S. production.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",
