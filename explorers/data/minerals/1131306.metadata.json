  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS historical data:\n- Note on global production: World production data prior to 1944 and for 1949–54 are reported in total gemstone-quality diamonds, plus industrial diamonds. World production data for 1944–48 and 1955 to the most recent year represent the total quantity of natural gemstones quality diamonds. Data are from the MR and the MYB.\n\nNotes found in original USGS data:\n- Production in 2020.\n- Production in 2021.\n- Production in 2022.\n- Production in 2023.\n- Estimated production in 2024.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",
