  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS historical data:\n- Note on global production: World production data were for primary magnesium produced. Data were from the MR and the MYB. Data were not available for 1915–36.\n\nNotes found in original USGS data:\n- Production in 2020. World total excludes U.S. production.\n- Production in 2021. Estimated for China and Russia.\n- Production in 2023.\n- Estimated production in 2024.\n- Production data in 2021 were also estimated.\n- Reported in 2022.\n- Reported.\n\nNotes found in original BGS data:\n- In addition, substantial quantities of magnesium compounds are produced by, used and recycled within the process of titanium sponge production. It is believed this relates to the mineral carnallite and/or secondary magnesium chloride compounds.\n- Magnesium used within the process of titanium sponge production is not marketed as primary magnesium metal and is therefore excluded from this table. Annual quantities are likely to be approximately: Russia 50,000 t, Kazakhstan 10,000 t, Ukraine 10,000 t.\n- Not marketed as metal but used in titanium production.\n- Excluding data from August to December for the Republic of Croatia.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",
