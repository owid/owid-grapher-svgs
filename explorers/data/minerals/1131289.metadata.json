  "descriptionShort": "Production of [boron](#dod:boron) as a share of global boron production. Based on mined, rather than [refined](#dod:refined-production), production.",
  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS historical data:\n- Note on United States production: Production data are essentially shipments and include crude ore, and boron minerals and compounds sold or used by producers, including actual boron oxide and marketable products. USGS boron data predate 1900; however, for these statistics, data are reported only for 1900 to the most recent year. Data for 1919–24 are reported as “shipped by producers.” Production data for 2006 to the most recent year are withheld. All data are in terms of boron oxide (B2O3) content. If the B2O3 content was not reported, it was calculated using the theoretical percentage of B2O3 in each borate mineral or compound sold or used. Data are reported in the MR and the MYB.\n- Note on global production: Data are world mine production. For most years, world mine production data are reported in gross weight. Data could not be converted to contained B2O3, because various boron units are used when reporting the minerals and compounds of boron. World production data are not reported for 1914–64. Data reported in the MR and MYB cover 1900–13 and 1976 to the most recent year and are all gross weight data. Data for 1964–75 are the calculated B2O3 content and are reported in the 1975 and 1980 MFP. World production data from 2006 to most recent do not include U.S. production.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",

For many of the commodities, data are reported as far back as 1900.\nThe data was compiled primarily from publications of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the U.S. Bureau of Mines (USBM). The principal references are the annual Minerals Yearbook (MYB) publication and its predecessor, Mineral Resources of the United States (MR). Other USGS and USBM publications used as references included: Statistical Compendium (SC), Metal Prices in the United States Through 1991 (MP91), Metal Prices in the United States Through 1998 (MP98), Metal Prices in the United States Through 2010, MCS and its predecessor Commodity Data Summaries (CDS), Minerals Facts and Problems (MFP), and various USBM Information Circulars. In some cases, USGS mineral commodity specialists added previously unpublished or recently revised data to the historical statistics series.",
