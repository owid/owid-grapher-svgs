  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS historical data:\n- Note on United States production: Data are domestic asbestos sold or used by producers. Data are from the MR and the MYB. Asbestos production in the United States ceased after 2002.\n- Note on global production: Data are world mine production of asbestos. Data are from C-1298 from 1900 through 2001 and from the MYB after 2001.\n\nNotes found in original USGS data:\n- Estimated production in 2020. For Brazil, the quantity refers to asbestos production permitted for export purposes only; the 2019 quantity is reported country exports. For Kazakhstan theproduction quantity in 2020 is reported.\n- Asbestos production in Brazil is permitted for export purposes only. The value shown represents reported country exports of asbestos in 2021.\n- Production in 2021. Asbestos production in Brazil is permitted for export purposes only. The value shown represents reported country exports of asbestos.\n- Reported data for Brazil and Kazakhstan. Asbestos production in Brazil was permitted for export purposes only. The value shown is reported country exports of asbestos because production data were unavailable.\n- Estimated production in 2022. Asbestos production in Brazil is permitted for export purposes only. The value shown represents reported country exports of asbestos. Reported for the United States and Kazakhstan.\n- Export sales reported by the only producer of asbestos in Brazil. In February 2023, the Supreme Federal Court of Brazil confirmed a 2017 judgment that the extraction, sale, and use of asbestos were unconstitutional. Despite the ruling, a company in Brazil continued to mine asbestos, citing the authority of a State law that authorized extraction and processing for export purposes.\n- Production in 2023.\n- Estimated production in 2024.\n- Production in 2021 is also estimated.\n- Estimated 2023.\n- Reported data for Brazil and Kazakhstan.\n\nNotes found in original BGS data:\n- In addition to the countries listed, Democratic P.R. of Korea and Romania are believed to produce asbestos.\n- In addition to the countries listed, Democratic P.R. of Korea, Pakistan and Romania are believed to produce asbestos.\n- In addition to the countries listed, Romania is believed to produce asbestos.\n- In addition to the countries listed, asbestos may also be produced in Afghanistan, North Korea, Romania and Slovakia.\n- Excluding data from August to December for the Republic of Croatia.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",
