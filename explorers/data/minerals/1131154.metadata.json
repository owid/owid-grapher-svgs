  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS historical data:\n- Note on global production: World production data represent world refinery production of selenium metal. Data were not available for 1900-37. World production estimates for 1985-1987 and 1997 to the most recent year do not include withheld U.S. production data. Data are from the MR and the MYB. Australia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Mexico, the Philippines, and Uzbekistan are known to produce refined selenium, but output is not reported, and information is inadequate for formulation of reliable production estimates. Production increase from 2011 to 2012 is as the result of the inclusion of new country data.\n\nNotes found in original USGS data:\n- Production in 2020. Excludes U.S. production. Australia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Mexico, the Philippines, and Uzbekistan are known to produce refined selenium, but output was not reported, and information was inadequate to make reliable production estimates.\n- Insofar as possible, data include refinery output only; countries that produced selenium contained in blister copper, copper concentrates, copper ores, and (or) refinery residues but did not recover refined selenium from these materials were excluded to avoid double counting.\n- Production in 2021.\n- Production in 2023.\n- Estimated production in 2024.\n- Reported.\n- Reported in 2022.\n- Reproted.\n- Refinery production data include Serbia, South Africa, and Uzbekistan. Australia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Mexico, and the Philippines may also have produced refined selenium, but output was not reported, and available information was inadequate to make reliable production estimates. Excludes U.S. production. Insofar as possible, data include refinery output only; countries that produced selenium contained in blister copper, copper concentrates, copper ores, and (or) refinery residues but did not recover refined selenium from these materials were excluded to avoid double counting.\n- Excludes U.S. production.\n\nNotes found in original BGS data:\n- In addition to the countries listed, Australia, Chile, Iran, the Republic of Korea and Zimbabwe are believed to produce selenium metal.\n- In addition to the countries listed, Australia, Chile, Iran, the Republic of Korea and Zimbabwe are believed to produce refined selenium.\n- In addition to the countries listed, Australia, Iran, the Republic of Korea and Zimbabwe are believed to produce refined selenium.\n- In addition to the countries listed, Australia, India and the Republic of Korea are are believed to produce selenium metal.\n- In addition to the countries listed, Australia, the Republic of Korea and Zimbabwe are believed to produce selenium metal.\n- In addition to the countries listed, Australia, Chile, the Republic of Korea and Zimbabwe are believed to produce selenium metal.\n- Includes production of secondary metal.\n- From 1985 primary recoverable only.\n- Includes selenium produced from imported material.\n- Including Se content of compounds.\n- In 1990 the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) was reunited with the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Therefore, from 1991 these 2 countries are shown simply as \"Germany\".\n- Excluding data from August to December for the Republic of Croatia.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",
