  "descriptionFromProducer": "Notes found in original USGS historical data:\n- Note on United States production: Production refers to the beneficiated phosphate rock product of phosphate ore ranging in grade from 26 percent to about 34 percent P2O5. This production is commonly referred to as marketable phosphate rock. Production data for 1900–14, 1932, and 1953 is equal to sold or used data. Data are from the MR and the MYB.\n- Note on global production: Data are defined as world production of marketable phosphate rock. Data are from the MR and the MYB.\n\nNotes found in original USGS data:\n- Production in 2020. Production data for China is for large mines only, as reported by the National Bureau of Statistics of China.\n- Production in 2021 is also estimated.\n- Production in 2021. Production data for China is for large mines only, as reported by the National Bureau of Statistics of China.\n- Also estimated in 2022.\n- Production in 2022. Production data for China is for large mines only, as reported by the National Bureau of Statistics of China.\n- Estimated production in 2023. Production data for China is for large mines only, as reported by the National Bureau of Statistics of China.\n- Production in 2021 is also estimated. Production data for large mines only, as reported by the National Bureau of Statistics of China.\n\nNotes found in original BGS data:\n- In addition to the countries listed, Indonesia and Uzbekistan are believed to produce phosphate rock.\n- In addition to the countries listed, Indonesia is believed to produce phosphate rock.\n- In addition to the countries listed, Indonesia and Nigeria are believed to produce phosphate rock.\n- In addition to the countries listed, Indonesia, Mali and Nigeria are believed to produce phosphate rock.\n- Including beneficiated and directly shipped material.\n- From 1975 to 1989 Cambodia was known as Kampuchea.\n- 10% P2O5.\n- Including lime phosphates.\n- Including phosphate dust.\n- In 1980 Rhodesia was renamed Zimbabwe.",
  "descriptionProcessing": "- The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.\n- As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.\n- Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.\n- The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.\n- Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.",

The principal references are the annual Minerals Yearbook (MYB) publication and its predecessor, Mineral Resources of the United States (MR). Other USGS and USBM publications used as references included: Statistical Compendium (SC), Metal Prices in the United States Through 1991 (MP91), Metal Prices in the United States Through 1998 (MP98), Metal Prices in the United States Through 2010, MCS and its predecessor Commodity Data Summaries (CDS), Minerals Facts and Problems (MFP), and various USBM Information Circulars.
