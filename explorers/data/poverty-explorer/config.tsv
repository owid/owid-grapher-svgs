'Per capita' means that the incomes of each household are attributed equally to each member of the household (including children).\n\nNon-market sources of income, including food grown by subsistence farmers for their own consumption, are taken into account.\n\nRegional and global estimates are extrapolated up until the year of the data release using GDP growth estimates and forecasts. For more details about the methodology, please refer to the [World Bank PIP documentation](https://datanalytics.worldbank.org/PIP-Methodology/lineupestimates.html#nowcasts).\n\nNOTES ON HOW WE PROCESSED THIS INDICATOR\n\nFor most countries in the PIP dataset, estimates relate to _either_ disposable income or consumption, for all available years. A number of countries, however, have a mix of income and consumption data points, with both data types sometimes available for particular years.\n\nIn most of our charts, we present the data with some data points dropped in order to present single series for each country. This allows us to make readable visualizations that combine multiple countries and metrics. In choosing which data points to drop, we try to strike a balance between maintaining comparability over time and showing as long a time series as possible. As such, the exact approach varies somewhat across countries.\n\nIf you would like to see the original data with _all_ available income and consumption data points shown separately, you can do so by selecting _Income surveys only_ or _Consumption surveys only_ in the Household survey data type dropdown or by clicking on _Show breaks between less comparable surveys_.	%	%	10;20;30;40;50;60;70;80;90;100	OrRd	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (2025)	World Bank (2025).

	Consumption surveys	consumption_spell_1	Numeric	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (2025)	Number of people living in households with an consumption per person below $10 a day.\n\nThe data is measured in international-$ at 2021 prices – this adjusts for inflation and for differences in living costs between countries.\n\nThe data relates to consumption per capita. 'Per capita' means that the incomes of each household are attributed equally to each member of the household (including children).\n\nNon-market sources of income, including food grown by subsistence farmers for their own consumption, are taken into account.\n\nRegional and global estimates are extrapolated up until the year of the data release using GDP growth estimates and forecasts. For more details about the methodology, please refer to the [World Bank PIP documentation](https://datanalytics.worldbank.org/PIP-Methodology/lineupestimates.html#nowcasts).\n\nNOTES ON HOW WE PROCESSED THIS INDICATOR\n\nFor most countries in the PIP dataset, estimates relate to _either_ disposable income or consumption, for all available years. A number of countries, however, have a mix of income and consumption data points, with both data types sometimes available for particular years.\n\nIn most of our charts, we present the data with some data points dropped in order to present single series for each country. This allows us to make readable visualizations that combine multiple countries and metrics. In choosing which data points to drop, we try to strike a balance between maintaining comparability over time and showing as long a time series as possible. As such, the exact approach varies somewhat across countries.\n\nIf you would like to see the original data with _all_ available income and consumption data points shown separately, you can do so by selecting _Income surveys only_ or _Consumption surveys only_ in the Household survey data type dropdown or by clicking on _Show breaks between less comparable surveys_.	https://pip.worldbank.org	World Bank (2025).

As such, the exact approach varies somewhat across countries.\n\nIf you would like to see the original data with _all_ available income and consumption data points shown separately, you can do so by selecting _Income surveys only_ or _Consumption surveys only_ in the Household survey data type dropdown or by clicking on _Show breaks between less comparable surveys_.	https://pip.worldbank.org	World Bank (2025).

A number of countries, however, have a mix of income and consumption data points, with both data types sometimes available for particular years.\n\nIn most of our charts, we present the data with some data points dropped in order to present single series for each country. This allows us to make readable visualizations that combine multiple countries and metrics. In choosing which data points to drop, we try to strike a balance between maintaining comparability over time and showing as long a time series as possible. As such, the exact approach varies somewhat across countries.\n\nIf you would like to see the original data with _all_ available income and consumption data points shown separately, you can do so by selecting _Income surveys only_ or _Consumption surveys only_ in the Household survey data type dropdown or by clicking on _Show breaks between less comparable surveys_.	https://pip.worldbank.org	World Bank (2025).
