Agricultural production shifts from the 25 countries projected to have the greatest mean losses of suitable habitat across all species to countries where less than 10% of species are threatened with extinction.	The goal of this scenario is to estimate the impact on biodiversity of land-use planning across international borders, avoiding expansion in the most at-risk countries. This scenario would be in conflict with food security and sovereignty, especially in countries where agriculture is a large source of income.
