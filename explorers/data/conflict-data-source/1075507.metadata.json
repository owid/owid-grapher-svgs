    "A civil conflict is defined by the [Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP)](https://ucdp.uu.se/) as a conflict between a state and a non-state armed group that causes at least 25 deaths during a year. A non-state armed group can be a rebel group, criminal organization, or ethnic group. Foreign states can still be involved in a supporting role. This includes combatant and civilian deaths due to fighting."
