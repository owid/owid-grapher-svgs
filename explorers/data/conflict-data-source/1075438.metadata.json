    "An armed conflict is defined by the [Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP)](https://ucdp.uu.se/) as a disagreement between organized groups, or between one organized group and civilians, that causes at least 25 deaths during a year. This includes combatant and civilian deaths due to fighting.",
    "We only count a conflict as new when the conflict overall started that year, not if it became active again.",
    "We count a conflict as new in a region even if the conflict started earlier or at the same time in another region. The sum across all regions can therefore be higher than the total number of new conflicts."
