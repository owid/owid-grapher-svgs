    "A civil conflict is defined by the [Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP)](https://ucdp.uu.se/) as a conflict between a state and a non-state armed group that causes at least 25 deaths during a year. A non-state armed group can be a rebel group, criminal organization, or ethnic group. Foreign states can still be involved in a supporting role. This includes combatant and civilian deaths due to fighting.",
    "We only count a conflict as new when the conflict overall started that year, not if it became active again.",
    "We count a conflict as new in a region even if the conflict started earlier or at the same time in another region. The sum across all regions can therefore be higher than the total number of new conflicts."
