    "An intrastate war is a conflict between a state and a non-state armed group, or between non-state armed groups, that causes at least 1,000 deaths during a year. This includes combatant deaths due to fighting, disease, and starvation. If a foreign state is involved, it is called \"internationalized\", and \"non-internationalized\" otherwise.",
    "We count a war as ongoing in a region even if the war is also ongoing in other regions. The sum across all regions can therefore be higher than the total number of ongoing wars."

The primary attributes of Version 5.1 are that: it includes updated data on the intra-state wars from 1816-2014; and it includes wars that were omitted from the GUIDE due to publication errors. The dataset is composed of two files: Intra-state-Wars v.5.1.csv; and Intra‐state_state_participant_v5.1.csv. The first (Wars) provides summary information on each war, while the second file (state_participant) provides information on the war experience of each of the individual states involved.\n\nYou can find more notes at https://correlatesofwar.org/wp-content/uploads/Intra-StateWars_Codebook.pdf",
