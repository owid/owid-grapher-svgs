    "An intrastate conflict is a conflict between a state and a non-state armed group that causes at least 25 deaths during a year. This includes combatant and civilian deaths due to fighting. If a foreign state is involved, it is called \"internationalized\", and \"non-internationalized\" otherwise.",
    "We only count a conflict as new when the conflict overall started that year, not if it became active again.",
    "We count a conflict as new in a region even if the conflict started earlier or at the same time in another region. The sum across all regions can therefore be higher than the total number of new conflicts."

      "description": "This project has generated a dataset on battle deaths (number of soldiers and civilians killed in combat) in state-based armed conflicts for the period 1946-2008.\n\nThe dataset is compatible with the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset for the period 1946–2008.\n\nA longer time series (1900-1997) compatible with the [Correlates of War database](http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets) was included in the first version (v1) of the Battle Deaths Dataset, available from the downloads section.\n\nFor academic exchanges on the PRIO data, see the following articles and rebuttals:\n\n\n- [Lacina & Gleditsch (2005) 'Monitoring trends in global combat: A new dataset of battle deaths'](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Monitoring-Trends-in-Global-Combat%3A-A-New-Dataset-Lacina-Gleditsch/0c4ff27fff986bc30112ac59ad6afbd7b719ad17?p2df).\n- [Obermeier et al. (2008) 'Fifty years of violent war deaths from Vietnam to Bosnia'](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20510162)\n- [Spagat et al. (2009) 'Estimating war deaths: An arena of contestation'](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20684623?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents).\n- [Gohdes & Price (2012) 'First things first: Assessing data quality before model\nquality'](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24545604?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents).\n- [Lacina & Gleditsch (2012) 'The waning of war is real: A response to Gohdes and\nPrice'](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24545604?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)\n\n\nThere are no plans to update the PRIO battle deaths dataset beyond 2008. The Uppsala\nConflict Data Program (UCDP) maintains a similar dataset from 1989, which is updated\nannually. For this dataset in different formats,\nas well as a codebook, go to the [UCDP Battle-Related Deaths Dataset](https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/).\n\nWhile the definitions are very similar, the coding practices may differ somewhat,\nand we generally recommend users of the two datasets to point out that these are\ntwo different, although closely related, datasets.",
