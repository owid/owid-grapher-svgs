Global warming: monthly sea surface temperature anomaly	false	auto	owid-distinct	LineChart DiscreteBar	false	This is measured at a nominal depth of 20cm, and given relative to the average temperature from the period of 1961 - 1990.
		1119971 1119976 1119974 1119978					Ocean heat content (top 700m)	false	https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/climate-change	Data explorer: how is the Earth's climate changing?	Global warming: heat content in the top 700 meters of the world's oceans	false	auto	owid-distinct	LineChart DiscreteBar	false	Ocean heat content is measured relative to the 1971–2000 average, which is set at zero for reference. It is measured in 10²² joules. For reference, 10²² joules are equal to approximately 17 times the amount of energy used globally every year.	Heat content is shown for four sources: Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); and Meteorological Research Institute (MRI).

Global warming: heat content in the top 2,000 meters of the world's oceans	false	auto	owid-distinct	LineChart DiscreteBar	false	Ocean heat content is measured relative to the 1971–2000 average, which is set at zero for reference. It is measured in 10²² joules. For reference, 10²² joules are equal to approximately 17 times the amount of energy used globally every year.	Heat content is shown for four sources: Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); and Meteorological Research Institute (MRI).

Ocean acidification: mean seawater pH	false	auto	owid-distinct	LineChart DiscreteBar	false	Mean seawater pH is shown based on in-situ measurements of pH from the Aloha station in Hawaii.		true
		1119999 1120000 1120004					Sea level rise	false	https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/climate-change	Data explorer: how is the Earth's climate changing?	Sea level rise	false	auto	owid-distinct	LineChart DiscreteBar	false	Global mean sea level rise is measured relative to the 1993 - 2008 average sea level. This is shown as three series: the widely-cited Church & White dataset; the University of Hawaii Sea Level Center (UHLSC); and the average of the two.

Climate change: change in mass of ice sheets	false	-5200	owid-distinct	LineChart DiscreteBar	false	Cumulative change in mass of ice sheets, measured relative to a base year of 2002. For reference, 1,000 billion metric tons is equal to about 260 cubic miles of ice—enough to raise sea level by about 3 millimeters.	Combined measurements are based on more than 20 different studies that have been combined for each region.
		1120006					Mass balance of U.S. Glaciers	false	https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/climate-change	Data explorer: how is the Earth's climate changing?	Climate change: change of mass of US glaciers	false	-50	owid-distinct	LineChart DiscreteBar	false	Cumulative mass balance of U.S. reference glaciers, relative to the base year 1965. This is given in meters of water equivalent, which represent changes in the average thickness of a glacier.
		1119987 1119989					Snow cover	false	https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/climate-change	Data explorer: how is the Earth's climate changing?	Snow cover in North America	false	0	owid-distinct	LineChart DiscreteBar	false	This metric measures the area covered by snow, based on an analysis of weekly maps. These data cover all of North America (including Greenland).
